Thiruvanan Thirumaran,"Honest review by Current student. 1. I had a very very bad experience from Jigsaw. not only me. I have lots of co students who had experience who studied from Jigsaw. 2. Certification : Certification is very useless. No companies are accepting the Jigsaw Certification. Even they are asking whats Jigsaw Academy. From this I understand Jigsaw only claims that it has been widely accepted by companies. Again it is a cheating (marketing gimmick) to enroll more students. 3.Counselling and Enrolling: Lots and lots of Fake statements given be counsellor (jigsaw) to enroll you. You ll realize once you jigsaw. If you want to lose your hard earned money in river, then you can proceed. 4. Placement : Wow, What a placement support. From the day i completed the course, lots and lots of job opportunities they are posting. But it requires experience. Haha. You cant apply to any of those companies. Please think about this - Those who want to enter into Analytics will have no analytics experience. If so, to whom they are sending the placement opportunties. Again its a marketing gimmick to enroll more students 5. Mock Interviews : Very very funny one. there are some faculties there whose behaviour will be very rude to students who ask doubts. Wow what a faculty support If you have huge money and dont mind spending for useless thing, you can invest here"
Vineeta Bansal,"I recently completed Data Science certification from Jigsaw. I found Jigsaw course contend and assignments is good enough to get hands on experience, learn data science and be industry ready. Faculty at Jigsaw always helped me to clear doubts.
I appreciate their placement assistance. They keep updating about job opportunity available in market in data science domain.I got job opportunity in well known analytics company via jigsaw placement.
So kudos to jigsaw."
Rita Makharia,"I have joined the big data and analytics course at jigsaw. Being a data analyst myself , I am very impressed with the course videos. The content of the videos is short crisp and clear with great examples. Easy to understand and more over their app is most useful. The biggest issue of online learning is about finishing the course. That is why the mobile app which jigsaw has launched for the students now helps u to finish the course more effectively. Now u can do your learning while u travel or whenever u have a few minutes to spare. This way it is easy to finish the course faster and better."
Anonymous,"i joined jigsaw in 2015 . i enrolled in SAS and R language . I paid around 67k for the combo course .
What i found after taking up the course :-
SAS course teaches you only the basics which doesn’t have much value. the certification offered is not recognized on a international platform . I regret not going for the Original Certification by the SAS community itself .
R course is much better .when compared to SAS .
They rush through the various topics .few short videos on each topic.
faculty is busy most of the days on corporate training if you call them . If you go for chat support even that goes to offline message . you need to raise a ticket for every damn issue .it gets sorted within 3 days max.
most of things you need to figure out on your own , if you are not that good in self study .dont go for an online course like this one . you will regret mostly .This is not for average students at all .
they help you out 20% ,remaining 80% its your own effort .You need to really work your ass off to complete the course .Faculty is helpful but they seem unavailable mostly and it becomes really difficult to get your queries solved through email or phone .You mostly end up browsing through stackoverflow for help .
Placement is not good at all .Most of the job which they post are for experienced eg:- 2–3 years of experience working in R and SAS , you ll end up wondering then why would you take up a course online for this , when you already working on it . getting placed is a pure luck . If you know multiple languages in data analytics and you are good at building models . Yes you can sure get a job .its all about working hard and not just joining the courses offered by them .Placement offered by them is mostly in bangalore . If you are ready to relocate , go for it .
THERE ARE LOADS OF FREE COURSES AND EVEN PAID COURSES WHICH ARE WAY BETTER THAN JIGSAW .
Analytics teaches you the strategy to market your business to attract buyers .Jigsaw is an awesome example for it . it has flashy marketing and 5 star reviews everywhere . the Company has put loads of effort in doing this(they contact the people who write bad reviews and make them remove it somehow) , i wish they would atleast put a bit of this effort in the course content and placement .
Its all upto you , how much effort you put in learning from various sources , books , youtube videos , practice practice . Jigsaw gives a certificate and few concepts .thats it ."
Dravid Deedfoot,"Completed Big data specialization course from Jigsaw. Course is well structured and easy to understand. Hands on experience via Lab and case studies make it lot more interesting to learn and grasp the content. Faculty support is good. Apart from the course, Jigsaw hosts lot of competitions where students can connect with industry experts and learn by working on projects in the competition. Really appreciate Jigsaw academy's efforts to conduct such events and engage students. Jigsaw is like a family. They have helped me build my profile in all possible ways and were always there when i needed them. I would recommend students and working professionals who want to get into big data analytics to join the Jigsaw community. As far as finding a job is concerned, Jigsaw will keep posting if there are any opportunities. Students need to spend some time building their profile and keep applying according to their skillset. Usually companies give 30% hike on your current CTC. But it may be more depending on the requirement, role and skillset for which company is hireing.

Pavan Kumar,"First of all I would like to thankful to Team JIGSAW! Recently,I got placed in GSAPNN TECHNOLOGIES, INC. as Jr Data Scientist Trainee.
Yes, Its worth of investing time and money but if and only if you have to do the course SINCERELY with PASSIONATE ON Data science.
They will help a lot if we show an interest toward it and as fresher It’s easy to learn from scratch with the help of their animated Pre-class video lectures. Its very easy to understand.
The assignments they created which are close to current scenario real time projects and you will feel while work on these projects like you are doing real time projects in data science industry.
The response from support team and faculty is good which will helps to solve doubts in less time. without any doubt they will show all possible ways to get success in the field of analytics."
Krishna Kumar,"I enrolled for the Jigsaw Data science certification because I wanted a job in analytics. The course was good, case studies were helpful and their faculty was prompt.
But I had a hard time looking for job openings. I was looking for a job in Hyderabad where my parents stay. All their job openings for Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai. I called many times but they did not give any openings in Hyderabad.
Finally, they put me in touch with a start up in Hyderabad. I got a job after clearing the interview.
I think Jigsaw Academy is good but they need to provide placement assistance for all cities in India."
Anonymous,"The Jigsaw Academy has come up with a very unique and neat way of presenting the concepts on Big Data(which I have attended-Big Data Specialist course).
The course was in depth , detailed and have provided nice videos on concepts like Map reduce, Pig,Hive.
Why to choose Jigsaw Academy?
Indepth knowledge on all concepts.
Good team for asking queries and getting it resolved.
Certifications from IBM can be easy when we go through this course.
Pain Points
Bigger and better real time projects.
More companies are in Noida or places (not Bangalore), which should help.
I would only like to add that the real time case studies can be made more regular."
Sushant Surankar,"Yes absolutely. I am currently working as Quality Engineer in Pune since 5 years and willing to switch to data analytics field now. So I joined Jigswa in April 2017 for data science specialization and never regret till now. The course content is perfectly designed so that any person understand basic mathematics will be able to understand easily, access to the study material, lab is also so easy. I think if anyone wants to step into Analytics career then Jigsaw is the best platform for them. Their support is so quick and efficient that if you face any problem and you contact them via email, call or chat they make sure that your issue/query will be resolved in a day. They are full of professionalism and care towards their students. They also keep organising webinars from well known personalities in analytics field. And this helps student like to gain confidence in what we are doing. Specially people like who are willing to change their role. This is indeed best training institue in data analytics/data science/machine learning and what not."
Malhar Takle,"Absolutely worth investing Time & Money. After completing my IT Engineering, I found the best online course of Data Analytics with Jigsaw Academy. Thanks to the friends who told me about it. I subscribed the online courses last year. Unfortunately, couldn’t yet complete the course due to my other works but really happy with the easiest video lectures and easy-to-understand content. Analytics being a new field, they have really worked well to make easy self-learning video tutorials. Hoping to finish it soon and work in the field of Data Analytics."
Debee S,"Jigsaw Academy would be highly recommended if you are willing to upskill on any of the latest technologies in the market. Their course structure is detailed and the faculties are very helpful.
I have had a great experience while doing a course at Jigsaw Academy. Initially i was a little skeptical about doing a online course and did a lot of research on various institutes, I neither had the time nor the bandwidth to take up sometime full time so I finalized on Jigsaw Academy after reading all the good reviews online and on Quora. But once i finished the course i was quite happy with the kind of knowledge i gained during the tenure of the course.
I personally believe that getting a job is all about having right skills and knowledge and Jigsaw does a decent job in empowering you with the best of knowledge. With the advent of so many new technologies it has become very vital to up skill for not only sustaining an IT job but upskilling at the same time.
You should definitely give it a shot and I would personally recommend their Machine Learning course as i did the same a while ago.
All the best & Thanks!"
Arun Mozhi Varman Rajagopal,"I enrolled in Jigsaw Academy for Data Scientist Course. It is a best online delivery center for Analytics.
They have best trainers and content for the course they are offering. Mainly on statistics even if we are not from the statistics background, the way they are explaining is easy to understand the logic behind that.
Faculty support is pretty good."
Sandeep Tyagi,"I have done 2 courses with Jigsaw Academy. I did the Foundation course in analytics in April 2013 and I recently completed the data science certification as well. I think if I share my experience it will help.
I got interested in analytics when my batch mate got a 6.5 lakh salary as a business analyst. I was making about 4 lakhs pa at that time and the idea of getting 15-20k more in hand was very appealing. I decided to learn business analytics and like most of my ideas it started with a Google search.
Eventually I landed on the Jigsaw blog and found very good information there. I think their blog is the best source of information on analytics. Personally, the decision to take their course was very influenced by the quality of the articles on their blog. I also like the videos on their youtube channel.
My initial experience with Jigsaw was not very good. My credit card payment was not going through and their team was not of much help. Finally, it got sorted and I started the course.
The best thing about the foundation course is that they try to keep it simple as much as they can. Of course, I still found SAS very intimidating when I started. But the support from the faculty was good.
I remember the sound quality of some the videos was an issue – the voice was not clear and sometimes their was an echo. I found the audio quality of the newer videos (data science course) a lot better. I have been told they have changed the audio quality of the foundation videos now as well.
I think the case studies at Jigsaw are very good. Some of my friends who have done courses in other places tell me the case studies there are more like discussions on a business problem. Whereas, the Jigsaw case studies require you to actually build predictive models on data. This is what helps a Jigsaw student –the case studies I did during my course are very similar to the kind of projects I do now at work.
Lately they have also started chat support for the students. This was not there during my first course and I think this is a huge help for students especially on weekends. Getting answers to your questions in real time really helps.
I have also seen a lot of Jigsaw copy-cats in the market now. They are trying to offer the same courses as Jigsaw, copying their platform, the virtual lab and everything else. I think imitation is the highest form of flattery and this proves to me that Jigsaw is doing a great job in teaching analytics.
Some other things to consider – they are the first ones to tie up with an academic institute of repute (Great Lakes management college) to offer a 1 year program in analytics. I heard their programs are now being offered in IIMs as well.
My friends in Accenture tell me Jigsaw does training for Accenture employees as well.
I think all of this points to a solid product and customer service. Personally, Jigsaw has helped me shape my career and I will forever be indebted to them for that."
Jismariya Jose,"As I am a beginner in analytics, Jigsaw provided me a good foundation in analytics. I have completed Data Science with SAS (self paced ) on last month.
The Course content is effective and it mainly cover SAS section and statistics section. We get to work on real time case studies which helps to get a clear insight about the topic.The LMS system where we can find the Pre class videos, class recordings of each class and course material are enough to explain the concept better. Also we can access Jigsaw Lab (Remote Desktop computer) helps to exercise our case study assignments and SAS codes as well .
The faculty and support team are very approachable and really helpful in our queries. They are ready to give individual attention and followup of our issues , a special thanks to Mr.Moses.
Overall I had a good learning experience with Jigsaw."
Praveen,"It all started when someone from Jigsaw called me up and pitched their course. I visited their website previously. I was contemplating on joining some good course to get myself acquainted with Data Analytics. I would have even went ahead to join their course, but their pitch seemed very aggressive. They claim to be the No.1 in India.
I was genuinely interested in the beginning but when I started asking more questions, I only got disappointing answers. All I was getting was generic answers. When I prodded more, she couldn't handle and transferred my call to some manager. He was of no help too. They claim to provide 100 percent placement assistance, so I was keen on knowing some stats. They said they currently had more than 5k enrolled students. All I asked was for some rough estimate of how many students got placed through their placement assistance. But I was asked to read testimonials on website and read reviews available online. They said they will get back to me on the next day.
I got a call the next day and this time, the manager transferred my call to some other higher official, Balaji, if I remember correctly. I made it clear that I had no doubts regarding their course but I stuck to my request that when they are claiming about the placement assistance, I want some data to support their claim. The same generic answers followed. They say, we have tie ups with 150+ companies. They are the No.1 in the country. They can provide me the best Analytics Course in the market but the placements depend on my learning capability. His response was a bit rude and he even accused me that I was trying to prove their agents wrong. Why on Earth would I care to prove their agent wrong. All I was asking was for some real stats, how many students are enrolled, how many were provided placement assistance, how many successfully got jobs, how many were able to make a career transition? I just asked for some real data. I did not ask for a 100% placement assurance. They did not give me a satisfying response.
I’m not going ahead with their course. They have been in this field for quite some time and I do not doubt their credentials. If learning is what you seek, I believe there are better options available at a much affordable cost."
Midhun,"Yes.
You get a deep insight into data analytics as you finish your course in jigsaw academy. You get to work on many case studies as well. There is a placement team, with whom if you register/keep in contact, keep sending you job postings that are around on the internet. Even Otherwise, once you register, there will be a tab for placements/job postings on your profile. They update everything there.
I also recommend trying out other websites around… The teaching methods differ and you can find the one that satisfies and suits you the most.
Happy Learning!"
Divya Abraham,"When I decided to do a course in analytics, I looked up quite a few instistutes before signing up for the data science course in sas from jigsaw and I am very glad about this because 9 months down the line, I have completed the course, attended interviews that jigsaw facilitated for me and I have a job now in a leading MNC. My experience at jigsaw has been really satisfying. The course content is designed to help even a beginner in this field. The faculty is very approachable and helpful. Yes, after completing the course, I also waited for a bit before I could get an opportunity to attend interviews, but I was in constant touch with the placement team who in turn was supportive in seeing me getting through an opportunity."
Nithya Lakshmi,"Really its very useful.
In my opinion I learnt lot about analytics from Jigsaw academy.
Recently I attended two webinars conducted by jigsaw Academy. Its very effective. NOw I got clear information about, how to get jobs in analytics field without having experience."
Sai Kumar,"I am a currently a jigsaw student. I enrolled for data science course. It's been few months now and the course is very good. The classes are well structured and easy to understand. It's very easy to interact with faculty regarding queries. Recently I attended webinar how to make up for lack of analytics experience conducted by Snehamoy Mukherjee. The session was really good and I learned a lot. This webinar helps people with lack experience in analytics field gain confidence. Hope jigsaw will conduct more webinars helping students gain knowledge.
Subrahmanya Sai Kumar Korapati."
Uday K,"I attended the BigData Specialist course, which I found to be very valuable with good knowledgeable instructors, good quality of video with detailed steps, and related infrastructure provided adequately.
While I might not be looking for a change/hike, I feel personally and professionally this course and Jigsaw has helped me expand my knowledge and skills adequately. I enjoyed the course material, which was very well structured and the instructor videos were of good quality, and the instructors oration was very well paced with live examples and system access, that helped adequately visualize the concept and hands-on approach.
I would truthfully suggest this course to anyone interested in expanding their skills and knowledge in new technology streams, but caution is that this is an extensive course with lot of development work (coding) that required serious commitment from the students to complete the coursework, and receive a certification."
Sandip Rath,Jigsaw Academy provides the knowledge with the lab practice that makes very easy to understand the concepts. Instructors were really experienced and their expertise in Big data course + analytics makes the subject very easy to understand. I recommend Jigsaw Academy who interested in Big data + analytic field.
Saurabh Singh,"Yes, its worth investing in Jigsaw …… I Joined jigsaw on 30th June 2013 for a combo course.
Before joining jigsaw I was almost in double mind whether I will get the satisfactory knowledge which i m expecting and for which i am paying a big amount.
But after 2 years I can say definitely that they are doing great work in the field of analytic by grooming the new bees and transferring the knowledge effectively.
Jigsaw facility and Support team is one of the best team which I have come across.
They were always present 24x7 to support and resolve the issue which the student face during the course.
The knowledge transfer which faculty has done is up to the mark. If the student follows each and every step which they have taught during the lecture, they will surely achieve what they want to."
Sanchita Lobo,"It is great to see interest about Jigsaw Academy on the Quora forum. As someone who is part of the Academy, obviously my views will be biased and therefore I don’t want to get into answering the questions directly. I do, however, want to give a few pointers on how to evaluate the effectiveness of the course.
In my opinion, the experience of the past students is the most effective way to evaluate a course or a training academy. At Jigsaw Academy, we have tons of feedback from our students that we can share with those who are interested. But yes it is easy to question the authenticity of the feedback. Or the authenticity of any other information that comes from the institute itself. There are, however, other ways of getting such information independently.
Here are 2 ways you can learn from the ex-students.
Social media chatter - You should also find out what people are saying about them on social media. Linked in recommendations should get a fair bit of weight age because its hard to get fake testimonials on LI since they are linked to a person’s profile.
Speak to ex-students - Take this a step further, and independently contact some of the people who have given the testimonials. This will give you a good idea about how much weightage to give to the testimonials. Also, you can call up the institute and ask for references of ex-students. Talk to the ex-students directly. Importantly, talk to ex-students who have not given any recommendation anywhere.
I think it is important for anyone who is spending their valuable time, effort and money in taking up a course to do proper research to identify the best option for their needs. I hope this post gives you a sense of how to leverage the experience of past students of an institute to make the right decision for yourself."
Satish Kumar,"My experience at Jigsaw Academy has truly been a remarkable one so far.
Jigsaw has provided a very professional approach to training especially the course content is designed with pre class videos, pre class reading materials, class session recording, quality assignments, quiz,case studies, competitions etc.
Trainers and support are very friendly, lively and approachable. The forum within LMS is interesting, practical and entertaining.
I would truthfully suggest Jigsaw to anyone interested in expanding their skills."
Gurpreet Singh,"My journey with Jigsaw have been thoroughly engaging, fascinating and satisfying. I have taken almost all courses offered by Jigsaw. All the course contents have been well researched and of high quality. I found the case studies to be especially thought provoking leading to hands-on learning. The courses are right on target in teaching us how to think like a statistician in handling various types of data.
The courses aptly cover the best industry practices to tackle various analytical problems. The assignments, quizzes and tests all aid in the learning. I feel I have attained comprehensive knowledge and experience to give me a jump start in my career as a future data scientist."
Ramesh Kumaran N,"I have enrolled for 4 courses in Jigsaw Academy. The course content is designed in such a way to give the overall understanding of topic. With many real time examples in videos and hands on individual lab session makes it a great deal to learn analytics from Jigsaw Academy.
The course content is provided with pre-class videos and pre-class materials which covers almost all the basic things needed for that particular class (Both Web based & Instructor led classes).
The faculty for the courses are knowledgeable and the interaction with faculty & support team is seamless in getting the issue resolved (whether it is related to subject/topic or general support). It just doesn’t stop with videos and materials. The Case Study will make us utilize all the knowledge gained and understanding the topics learnt. The case studies are designed in such a way to give the real-time experience in Analytics. The Forum or Discussion board makes the students to interact among themselves.
I would say that anyone who can sufficiently devote 2-3 hours per day or a minimum of 10 hrs per week can complete the course on time balancing the professional and personal duties."
Rajiv Chaturvedi,"Yes definitely. I am a student at present, and can say it has been a very satisfying experience so far. Much beyond what I had initially expected.
What I like best is the course design. The focus is 100% on practical application - clearing the interview, securing the job, and actually solving the client problem once in the hot seat. Not obscure theory, formulas, etc. The instructors and course material stress this all the time, which is great.
Personally I am very happy with the pace of the class, but some students do find a few classes too fast. In almost all cases its because they have not gone through the pre-class videos. This is something instructors stress on all the time.
Instructors really know their stuff. Students are constantly asking them 'what if' kind of questions, and you can tell the faculty are speaking from experience on what works and does not. You can reach out to faculty anytime... very useful when you are just not getting some concept, or working on a tough assignment.
There is also a forum where students post questions and get response from other students and faculty. This forum is very useful. You can be part of various study groups, usually from classmates in the same batch.
Equally impressive is their support team headed by Qurrat. I have had minor signon issues etc, but all were very speedily resolved. They actually monitor the forum for assignment related questions etc posed by students which I quite like. And they respond promptly. I also like the realtime chat support.
My few suggestions to any incoming student : 1) Take advantage of their promotional pricing deals, its really worth it 2) Make sure you have at least 10-15 hours to go through the pre-class videos before every class, or you will be lost 3) Reach out to faculty and other students actively, it will save you a lot of time and guesswork when doing assignments.
All in all, a great experience. Highly recommended."
Abhisek Nayak,"Jigsaw Academy is one of the best online analytics institute and also tied-up with india best institute like IIM,Great-lakes inst of mangement,some international school.They offer various platfrom of analytics like SAS,R and Hadoop(for Big Data analytics).
I was enrolled couple of courses and completed Data science with R course,its good option to put your money and time for your analytics journey.Now days analytics and Bigdata analytics is best career option and if you want shift into this field and eager to learn baseline and advanced concept and technique than Jigsaw is the best option to go with.
Because the teaching metheodology ,hands on exercise and real case study are pretty awesome.
The LMS system where you can find all the course material,pre classes video and class recording and its very smooth access.
The RDC(Remote Desktop Computer) system where you can exercise your assignmets,case study on SAS ,R programming tools.Furthermore if you stuck somewhere in technical problem or in assignment problem,just mail or a phone call to support team,they instantly support you and they are very fast.
Finally you have to put at least 10 to 15 hours for the course work then go with Jigsaw because the course content and assignment are so much deep in concepts and once you do that and puts extra hard work ,you can even participate in Kaggle(The world largest Data science competation).Also Jigsaw helps to find the right opportunity in career of analytics."
Aakash Mitra,"Yes, If you have background in analytics. No if you are in other background and trying to get into analytics with their certification and assistance which is almost zero. As i tried to do the same and felt like disposing my money in junk so its better to think 100 times before joining the courses."
Neel Biswas,"I enrolled in Jigsaw Academy and i did a lot of research before doing so. And i guarantee that its the best Private Analytic Institute out there.
They have the best trainers available, specially sarita who has managed things very efficiently and not to mention the statistics part , which she teaches like a piece of cake.
The video based course allows you to change the pace of the class which helped me to complete the Foundation Course with SAS in just 12 days (7-9 hours daily) and it was worth every second and every penny.
They also have an Arsenal of Real Time case studies which help you to practice and get in depth knowledge of data/domain which is available in their online lab (accessible 24*7 ).
P.S - If you are ready to spend quality time for analytics then this course with Jigsaw will be your best choice , but if you are too lazy to work ( which is not too much as jigsaw even provides what to do next when you are stuck somewhere and even has a discussion section for contacting peers) then you better not join any analytic course and sit on your couch sipping coke and watching Game Of Thrones (i am a fan by d way :) )"
Bhawna Gupta,"I am doing Big Data Scientist Specialization - R /Hadoop/Tablue. Chose Jigsaw as they are very good on Online delivery of Education. Being it content, pace of study, online support, remote desktop connections too practice, support through mail, phone, chat system. One can test your understanding of each topic through the quizzes and assignments for each topic. Infact recording is provided for each class has good quality. Thanks Jigsaw for helping me in my quest. Overall I can say best place to join, if wish to really learn. At Jigsaw content is designed to cover almost every detail on topic, so it saves time to search further on topic, and thus saves money."
Sourav Biswas,"It is a very compact course and good to learn analytics from the scratch.For me yes it is worth investing time and money. I was totally new to analytics and it really helped me a lot to change or restart my career. In 69000/- I got the Big Data Unicorn which includes- SAS,R,PYTHON,EXCEL,BIG DATA ANALYTICS,APACHE SPARK, APACHE STORM,CASSANDRA,MONGODB which I think quite affordable. The case studies and assignments are really helpful to gain knowledge.I finished the data science course in 8 months. And just after finishing it,I got an Internship opportunity from Jigsaw in a Marketing Analytics Company in Bangalore with some kind of job assurance as per my performance in the internship period. Some feedback I would like to share that- the python course can be bit more informative. There should be a capstone project in python. Implementation of decision tree in SAS would be a good option and also some algorithms like KNN,random forest,bagging,boosting,stacking,K fold cross validation can be included in R. Faculties are good. Promptness in response to the tickets from the faculties, is average. Placement support is very good."
Megha Sushanth Kodela,"I enrolled with Jigsaw Academy for Data Science with SAS and Data Science with R. The course content is not only effective, but its also very practical. The faculty and support staff are very friendly and ever helpful. The best part is that the assignments actually require you to apply all the concepts taught in the class. All in all Jigsaw gives you a full-fledged learning experience."
Gaurav Tiwari,"did any jigsaw student get placed ?
I enrolled in Jigsaw Academy in August 2015 based on promise made by the Jigsaw career counselor that i will be get placed after completing course though i have 5 yrs of exp.
I completed my course(secured -90%) in feb 2016 and still struggling to get the JOB.
additionally, i have not received any interview /job offer through their internal job posting .
People boasting about Jigsaw academy are either Jigsaw faculty or Jigsaw marketing team member .
Don't get trapped
Regards
Jigsaw Student"
Bhargav RK,"Yes... Its worth investing in this course, as it would definitely add to the career and new avenues to grow towards analytics. For beginners its a good platform to start with if they are interested in Market analytics, business analytics.
Investing time. Yes its worth as they give the best information and training for your time invested. core statistical knowledge is refilled here for marketeres.
I would definitely recommend to keep Jigsaw as the first choice to learn analytics."
Vivek Chenna,"I had enrolled for the DATA SCIENCE for SAS course with Jigsaw.I must admit ,that the course is well designed.Blend of pre-class videos on different sections and live instructor led classes certainly helped me comprehend programming concepts and analytical techniques available across excel and SAS.The LMS is also seamless.
Kudos to the faculty and support team as well.They have always been prompt with clarifying doubts."
Kamraj Subramanian,"I completed foundation in analytics and data scientist courses at jigsaw during the last year. Quality student care and investment worthy course contents are some of the highlights of jigsaw academy. Getting my first job was a calkwalk with the help of Jigsaw placements. In the interviews i have attended so far, Jigsaw academy certification is been considered by all of them. It is no wonder i still turn up to the experts in jigsaw for suggestions. With salary packages doubling every year for a data science professional, i would definitely say it is a good investment for the future."
Balaji Athreya,"For a person who knows SAS and has been using it for data analysis and programming, the obvious next step would be to move forward to analytics field or DW area (SAS BI,DI etc).
I decided to pursue my career in analytics as I developed interest while working for a pharma client. I searched many courses and options and finally decided on Jigsaw academy. Believe me we can get value for both time and money invested.
Being a Jigsaw student myself, I can assure you that you will get good exposure to analytics field and techniques in a way which a non statistics person can understand. Of course every person needs to put some hard work to learn a new skill."
Anonymous,"Like Millions of Quora users, today I just thought to pen my feedback regarding a revolution that has already since the recent past and is very active on all Social communication media, and also has been flashed on many journals and top newspaper articles.

Preetham R Rao,"Jigsaw Academy is a great place to Learn Analytics. I previously have ha no experience in Analytics and as a field it really interested me. I did a lot of research and finally zeroed in on 2 institutes in Bangalore for a course on Analytics( My main interest was SAS). After speaking to a few people, I realized Jigsaw was the place to be. Even on doing a good amount of comparisons online(One comparison was between Jigsaw and IIM-B) , I decided that Jigsaw was the institute to enroll for. Though the other option was much more cheaper, at the end of the day, you always select the place from where you could be better off in the future than sooner!
The faculty quality is nothing short of exceptional! Fabulous, Experienced, practical as well as a very good hands-on approach to each topic. Especially, considering that SAS is a programming language, a hands-on approach is almost inevitable and this is what makes Jigsaw stand out! Sarita: probably the Best Analytics Prof! You could teach a nation Analytics!! Shilpa Jat: Thank you for constatntly replying to my incessant number of doubts in the assignments!! You have constantly supported and helped me with my issues and topics! Thank you very much!!
The support is another brilliant team. Every time I've had issues, they have responded positively as well as promptly! To cite an instance , I was facing an issue while connecting to a Remote Desktop. It was a lazy Sunday Afternoon and I sent a mail to the Support. I immediately(< 5 mins) received a reply which sent me a step-by-step procedure to sort out the issue and I was back to my assignments! Thank you Moses, Ramesh and the Team!!
Overall a great institute! A great future to a great start-up!!"
Charlotte Pinto,"Jigsaw academy course is really one of the best course for career growth who aspiring and already working in analytic industry. It has good approach which focuses on very much real time aspects and industry exposure by providing case studies and assignments to students. The class recording and video sessions gives students flexibility of individual lessons whenever and repeated number of times they want. Recording and video sessions are valuable essence of this course.
Jigsaw academy provides wonderful faculties and staff who really help students in their queries. They are very supportive and helpful. Jigsaw academy concentrates on each of their student’s growth in academy. It is worth investing time and money on this course. This course covers topics like Regression analytics, data exploration and preparation, Decision Trees from the perspective of Business Understanding etc, which requires in real time scenarios. These studies helps students grow in their analytic career."
Vaishnavi Reddy,"I had to enrolled for the online analytics course with certain apprehension about the approach but right from the start my worries were laid to rest. I enrolled for the video based classes of the foundation course. I opted for this primarily because of ease of access to the class recordings given I had to deal with my 2 year old toddler. The content was crisp,to the point and simple.Concepts were explained in very simple terms and the faculty chat option to resolve any queries was also great.The assignments ensured I got a feel of how real time problems can be approached through analytics.
This course has helped me regain my confidence in venturing smoothly into new areas if my interest given I come from banking background with core expertise in marketing.
Thank you jigsaw for opening the world of analytics for me."
Murali Sundarajan,"I had completed the Analytics with Excel and Visual Basic for Analytics programs through jigsaw it was great experience for me to learn at my own pace. currently planing to take a IoT course and along with Machine learning and AI.
Course contents are good and easy to understand and learn. The case studies helped me to understand how to solve the problems. In terms of the faculty support it was really up to the mark. Whenever i raised any concerns it was resolved within the stipulated time. Such vivid experiences made my choice to do analytic with Jigsaw really awesome.
The class videos are easy to understand and explains in a simple way and it's really helpful for my carrier switch-over.
They are offering courses with affordable price compare to other online provider & course content and lab facility will be the cheaper price and good time utilization for improving our knowledge.
Overall, this has been a great experience and would recommend to my friends who are busy to go to classroom training. Great training experience!!!!"
Shankar Dollin,"One of the Worst academy I never experienced in my life, Big Cheater, Loot your money by providing false hopes. They promised 100% Job Placement, lifetime access for the course content, hands-on experience their ongoing project & so many things while enrolling the course. After paying the money they don't care about anything, they will not respond to your call & queries raised by you. Now they have removed my access but they have promised for lifetime access.. All bulshit they will talk while enrolling & make you ""Bakara"" . Yes, I am one the big ""Bakara"" I have trusted them & paid ""120000"" rupees, at last, i got zero, yes a big ZERO in the return.
They have played with my career. now jobless because of the jigsaw. they have promised me 100% job placement, I left the existing job to complete the course & this advised by them only, after completing the course they raised their hands.
Totally waste of your time & money, at last, you will spoil your career.
This is my HONEST Review on JIGSAW.
Please think before enrolling any JIGSAW courses."
Anonymous,"I was planning to enrol for the Jigsaw Course on Big Data & Hadoop but initially enrolled for their short course with Jigsaw Academy on Fraud Analytics using Logistic Regression. This was to test how good is this institute and whether my investment (Rs 42k) going to be worth. Personally, I have over 10 years experience in Analytics and have used Logistic Regression several times so it was good to test them.
I found the course below average. The good parts are the SAS code, word document and their over enthusiastic pre-sales team. The good things ended pretty quickly and I was left with a poor experiencc. The instructor almost rushed through the material and didn't explain the rationale behind the steps, which was a major disappointment. Several key points prior to carrying out a logistic regression were skipped and several key checks one would carry out post logistic regression were completely missed out. The worst part was I sent over a list of questions on the video and it is 20+ days as I write this and still no response (where is their promise of quick response?).
If you are complete beginner in analytics and take this course, you may be impressed but with reasonably good experience in analytics, you will be totally disappointed. I am not sure how other online courses compare but I have seen some good stuff on Coursera/Udemy or even Youtube which are a lot better and free. So please think carefully before investing your money and time in doing courses with such institutes."
Jalpesh Borad,"I enrolled in Jigsaw academy for Big Data course in 2016. As a fresher, it was good start for me with theories and hands-on experience in Big data analytics. For me, invested time and money earned me good job.
Each topic in course had enough theories and hands-on exercises that i had to do on their distributed learning platform which enriched concepts about big data infrastructures.
After completing course, they provided placement assistance with some mock interviews, resume building etc.
Overall, its worth investing time and money in Jigsaw academy"
Animesh Devarshi,"Indeed a great learning experience. The course at Jigsaw academy is well structured and application based. The standard of assignments and case studies are high which will help in getting strong hold of fundamental concepts.Initially I enrolled in ""Data Science with R"" but after seeing the rapid improvement in my learning curve I enrolled into ""Jigsaw Wiley Big Data Specialist"" course as well which is equally good.."
Anonymous,"There exist far less costly and more useful courses. Search around. Lets clarify one thing here about the upcoming branding claims; they were the early movers in a fairly new field, they are trying to cash in those [3-4?] years of their presence in the google results! , instead of the product. Compare the content and services being offered and you'd see a far clearer picture and then decide.
About time investment, that's your call. You give time to yourself, you give money to them.
Break down the question:
1.Will the business analytics [and other such courses] would help me learn new things/ my career etc. ?
2. Business analytics in itself, being a broad subject, what things do i need to learn and in what order?
3. Who all are offering to teach all these things. and then whom should i select.
__________________________________________________________
This part is to help you differentiate between fake and genuine. and I had to write this because of this ""well researched"" tag mentioned in one of the answers.
- Do find out who are the participants and other ""academies"" who received the prestigious ""Analytics Academy"" award. May be i'm the only who finds it fishy.
-Analytic india mag, does list many other courses and happens to be a paid blog. You should use that to find what other options you have, all good institutes have themselves listed there. But i would take their ""Opinions"" with a pinch of salt. I find it suspicious that most of the good news about Jigsaw comes from there.
-About linkedin reviews, Coursera doesn't even has that section, why? they dont need it. I randomly searched for google and in its product section it was recommended by ""327"" people. Google recommended by just 327 people. Bottom line, no body really cares for a linkedin review , its a marketting gimmick, you have 65 reviews if you push for it. Certainly a good marketing move , if someone falls for it."
Raktim Akash,"Most people who gave positive feedback for Jigsaw here, interestingly has given only one answer in Quora. Looks like they joined Quora to campaign for Jigsaw only. Highly Suspicious!!"
Rupesh Sharma,"Before answering these questions, I would first ask you to get a clarity whether you would be able to take online course or not. Because online courses need more dedication and input than offline courses. Good thing about online courses is that you can study according to your convenience but you have to make sure that convenience doesn't get converted to laziness.
Now coming to Jigsaw academy, no doubt it is a reputed institution. I enrolled myself in data science course. Being a mechanical engineer, I thought it would be difficult to catch up things. But they start each and every topic with very basic and I didn't find any difficulty in understanding the subject. There will be topic wise assignments that we have to complete to get certification, and that is a good part. There will be case study for each topic that will help you to work on real time problems.
I found the course content to be enough to understand the concepts of data science. For depth of knowledge, later you can refer books.
From money point of view, I found it little costly but worth.
For job, they keep sending mails regarding vacancies. Only problem here is that most of the companies ask for experience in the required domain. And it will be there in any job requirement irrespective of the institution.
Hike percentage depends on different factors like your knowledge, your background etc. and not just institution.
In a nutshell, you can go for the course but make sure to check the course content before. And remember, any institute can provide you the study material, but how much you learn from it depends only on you."
Bhaumik Shah,Jigsaw’s online courses are really worth the time and investment…..their faculties are always ready to help whenever required. I received internship through jigsaw in one of the prominent digital analytics company in bengaluru. From my personal experience I can say it’s better than many full time data science courses running in market…..would surely suggest it to anyone who wants to start their journey into analytics.
Ambika Jan,"I shall share my experience, if that helps:
I am currently doing my IoT full stack course from Jigsaw. I have also completed a couple of other online courses (machine learning, data science, etc.).
The key difference is the faculty addressing each issue, discussing with you over a call, as soon as you create a ticket, quick turnaround faculty support. Also, when asked for additional support, apart from the course, they were more than happy to support me, which is according to me a great learning experience.
They also give scholarships to deserving candidates, which is also a very attractive feature. I have availed the scholarship.
While I was researching on IoT courses, the course content on Jigsaw was much promising for a beginner in IoT. And it has helped me to gain knowledge and build a couple of simple products too.
They have now tied up with IBM as well, which means once I complete IBM IoT, I get 2 certificates. I am looking forward to completing that as well. Double gain.
I recommend this course to all who are beginners in IoT, who wants to know about Arduino, Node MCU, Raspberry Pi and interactions among these 3, getting it synced with Cloud, etc.
It may not be like any other online courses, each online-course-provider is different. But they are always open to suggestions/feedback.
Also, there are many interesting features like twice a week they have brain-teasers (if you like puzzles, etc. and if you win it, you get goodies too). Good industry articles every day. Monthly Webinars and open-houses, which I have not seen happening in any other online courses so far.
This makes it more interactive, and there is good interaction with students from the industry experts, support team and faculties.
I am enjoying my learning and plan to build some IoT products soon.
I have not availed any placement services yet and not sure about the hike as well."
Dakarapu Raja Dhinakaran,"I have learnt R and BigData Analytics in Jigsaw Acedamy. After certification, placement cell assisted me.
Jigsaw placement team is doing a fairly good job in terms of polishing our resume as per the market requisite and then getting it forwarded to right place.
On regular basis, students keep getting the list of openings in various companies."
Shashidhar,"I have enrolled for the Full Stack Data Science course from Jigsaw Academy.
The course has weekend online sessions (Saturday and Sunday) and also promised some good reference course material and content to follow for the rest of the week and prepare for the classes the following weekend.
To my surprise, the material provided was very minimal and just brushed on the major topics.I still had to search and refer materials online. The quality of teaching was pretty average. Before enrolling, I was told that they have faculty with industry experience of more than 15 years. But, I found some of them were new to data science having less than 5 year experience.
Overall I feel I did a mistake by joining this course from Jigsaw academy. There are more good quality courses and institutes out there."
Anonymous,"Personally, I looked at their course and fee structure and I don't think it is justified to take the course.
Also, noticed something fishy on the website. Sarita' linkedin profile link does. It googled her name, but couldn't find any strong evidence of her having studied at Tufts U.
p.s. Anybody is free to prove me wrong."
Anonymous,"I have 7 years experience in data analysis using SAS and R with no formal education in statistics and data science or predictive modeling. Initially, I struggled a lot when it comes to applying analytics in different domains. However, When I joined as student at Jigsaw Academy,Online School of Analytics, I became better at data analysis. I was able to understand which data mining to use to solve a business problem,how to interpret results, what and how to communicate results of data analysis with others in business language.
I feel happy about joining Jigsaw to get trained in analytics by good mentors and faculties. After completing the foundation training at jigsaw, I feel, I made the right decision in my career. I received lot of Interview calls and Job offers from many organization for various analytics position.Thanks to Jigsaw and team for making analytics training available at a very nominal fee compared to other analytics training program in the world.
It has been more than 3.5 years, my quest for data analytics field is increasing day by day. The benefits and ROI I am reaping even today, is worth more than the training fee.
Moreover, I made many like-minded friends here, who are always there to support and guide me in my Analytics career.
And I suggest other students before joining any training program to evaluate what are we really getting in terms of learning and networking opportunities and what are the losses in not joining the Jigsaw Academy analytics ecosystem. Not to forget the benefits of Online classes, which save your travel time and other time and gives you increased time span at home for practicing data analysis."
Prajan Kumar Hegde,"I had a very good learning experience with Jigsaw Academy so far. I have been enrolled for Data Science with SAS. The course content was amazing and trainer focused on practical approach and discussed industry related problems and solutions. Their real time scenarios have added a great value to my knowledge and work.
The best part of Jigsaw is it’s staff are very supportive, specially Mr. Moses, who is very kind, approachable anytime, helps people from the starting of course to till the end, I will rate Jigsaw Academy as the best in the Industry and I have referred lot of my friends and colleagues to Jigsaw Academy. It’s an value for your money.
Hope this helps…."
Anonymous,It was a good decision for me to invest money in Jigsaw’s course. I had taken a sabbatical for 8 years & is now a data scientist because I took up this course & let them groom me with their industry experience & knowledge. If you have decided to be a data scientist then Jigsaw can actually groom you into one.
Ramaswamy Muthukrishnan,I would certainly recommend Jigsaw Academy. I have completed Data Science with R & SAS in 2015 and 2016 respectively and presently I am doing Big Data Certification. I am very much happy that I learned a lot from them. The course contents are right from the basics of Analytics to Programming Part. My experience with the academy until now has been remarkable. The course contents and assignments are very appropriate. Trainers/Customer Support for various issues like Conceptual Doubts/Assignments/LMS...etc will been resolved ASAP.
JERIL JOSEPH,"Hi,
I had enrolled for a combo course in Jigsaw Academy in the month of January, 2016. This is an earnest opinion, i dont think its worth investing in jigsaw, i am just regretting spending money here and the fees here is huge for no reason but the services is bad. Because the material i feel is way too simple for us to do any assignments given by them, which is too complex. Secondly, even after lodging a complaint, the faculty doesn't even bother to cal back or even if we intimate to the support team the issues we are facing, they show concerns(by repeatedly telling sorry’s) but no action is taken. I, initially thought i was not following the course, but it turns out majority of people are finding it difficult to understand jigsaw's material nor unable to do the assignments and the worst part is that u pay the entire money initially leaving us with nothing, so even if we face difficulties there’s no need for jigsaw to show interest, since they have the money in their hands, speaking about the fees, for thee quality they are providing the fees is skyrocketing which is not even worth. Finally with despair, pain and tears i am regretting joining jigsaw academy, a lot i have spent on this institute for which i am in deep pain and which i know i wont get back too. I see below lots of good reviews, which might be hardly 1–2% of candidates enrolling the rest are struggling. Kindly look into other options who are giving for cheaper and better services. Jigsaw is all about money and no services"
Harshit Satya,"Right now I am pursuing a data science course from Jigsaw academy. I have gone through content of course and I have also enrolled for other data science online courses but lessons tought in jigsaw course are far better than others and specially for one important reason is that the ease with which they present the information and how to implement the same practically.
The assignment they provide are really great for practice.
But the most important thing that I learnred in last 4 months of my course after going through lectures and attending webinars is that if you want to get placed in a company instead of learning all the tools you should focus on techniques to implement.
If you are good in one tool than practice each in every technique in that.
All the best."
Satya Reddy,"My answer will be YES.
I am currently doing Data Science course here.
I have done my research on all the Course providers before joining here. I have to admit these guys are providing budget friendly courses and Virtual Labs so no need to have high RAM Computers and Install costly software. I am having 18 months access to all the labs in my Course.All we need to have is a net connection and even a notepad will do the job. This is a more reasonable option while choosing a course."
Rajeev Bhatia,"Jigsaw Academy is the pioneer in the Data Scientist courses in India. Realizing the potential of data analytics and the important role it is going to play in the coming years, I enrolled myself in PGPDM at Jigsaw Academy in the year 2015. What I observed here is that participants are equipped with skill sets relevant to the job market and as such placement opportunities are good.
However, you need to honestly assess your career goals, interests and aptitude before enrolling in any particular course. You can take up these courses if you are interested in switching tracks or honing your skills further for better and more challenging job opportunities."
Akhil Chinna,Jigsaw academy is very good. In showing the content and explaining the course. Faculty is too good in explaining the contents and doubts.
Ravi Kumar,"Jigsaw Academy is a leading online analytics and big data courses provider. After getting feedbacks from the students and researching over the internet, it would be right to say that these courses can accelerate your career in the right direction. Interactive teaching assisted by webinars, discussions and assignments, problem-solving and in-depth analysis of the subject will offer you a unique learning experience, and develop expertise readily recognized by the job market. You will gain expertise and experience in the field of data analytics. However, you need to show higher level of commitment and dedication to derive the maximum from the experience and knowledge of instructors.
With highly promising prospects for a rewarding career and salary hikes, these courses will be worth investing your time and money. It can be analyzed from students’ reviews and placement record that the academy also provides excellent placement opportunities with the top recruiters like Genpact, IBM, Accenture, Wipro, etc. Professionals after completing a course in data science and analytics easily get salary between INR 6 lakhs to 12 lakhs in India and $65,000 to $130,000 globally at entry level."
Jinesh Khimsaria,Is this a good time to switch career & change profile for a 6 years IT experienced person who has no practical experience in data analytics? I'm asking this coz i found data analytics interesting but I'm skeptical in commencing my career as a fresher with this new job profile
Kinnaree Patel,I took this course as I was a beginner and I found the course to be very informative. It gave me enough lab hours to practice and the class room videos were up to the mark. I was able to accumulate a lot of knowledge about sas. The support team is also very helpful. They are there for you whenever you need them.I am planning to take a big data course as well.
Sudeep Rao,"Very detailed plan for the course. Extremely knowledgable staff.
The way each chapter plunges into depth by starting off with a very basic level is appreciated."
Anonymous,"I am a Jigsaw student currently enrolled for IoT course.
In short, what one needs is hold on a topic which you get with good knowledge.
The course content is very good…needs lot of hardwork and dedication to complete the course.
I have no idea about recognition of certificate from Jigsaw. They get recognized only when ppl show good knowledge and get well placed.
Apart from this, faculty support is kind of okay…..only compliant is that we need to raise ticket for any issue. Faculty not available on call.
The course content access is provided only for 365 days which according to me needs to be reconsidered as there are many academies which offer lifetime access. Since the courses are bit expensive and also course content is huge and complex, lifetime access must be provided.
Regarding placements, I too was told some flatterring success stories…was assured of CV update support and job opportunities. The services are there. But what I see is that the jobs posted are for ppl with <2yrs exp and not for high experienced ppl."
Pandu,"Data science course in Jigsaw academy is good interms of content, live class sessions, general support experience and faculty support.
Q&A session is good interms of having regular sessions. Overall experience was better in learning and getting excited to tools.
A special thanks to Mr.Moses who have helped in every aspects throughout the course.
Looking forward for the placement support."
Diwakar Singh,I can see lots of people here giving positive feedback here for Jigsaw. But haven't seen anyone who has taken the course and has got the job. Anyone??
Saugat Nayak,"I can say it is absolutely worth investing both time and money for the Jigsaw courses.
Various courses provided by Jigsaw are most conversant courses which are required to be into Analytics role. The study approach that Jigsaw follows and the real time cases which are provided to solve really helps students to get the feel of the kind of role they are aspiring for. While being in course, they gets their hands free on various modelling techniques that are used in industries on real time.
Also the placement team is doing a fairly good job in terms of polishing your CV as per the market requisite and then getting it forwarded to right place. On regular basis, students keep getting the list of openings in various companies. We should understand that Jigsaw does anything possible for any candidate for getting placed, but getting through depends on various factors like how confident are you on the subject matter; has the hiring company shortlisted your profile; are you at par with what the requirement is; your current pay; any many more. Any institute (as far as I know) provides the assistance in job, but nobody guarantees you in landing into any job. They can only shape you up as per the market, but getting through depends on factors which I mentioned.
Hike percentage entirely depends on the level you are into, the designation and band you are going to be, the company standard, confidence on the subject matter and practicability."
Toshit Andola,"I also find same points mentioned above by this person, I also enrolled to same course and not find it that great. If 80% effort u need to make so better go for udacity, coursera , udemy with international reputation, When going for placement u need to be 3 year experienced in same field, then why one would go for these courses from Jigsaw.
No mentoring, no guiding , nothing . I took intructor led course, it was same as video lectures. And I paid 20000 extra for this."
Pratik Kumar,It's worth it to join jigsaw to develop skills placement and faculty support are good .for fresher it's good to join jigsaw classroom program
Yogendra Patil,"Very bad experience, dont prefer online education, you will never satisfied your money will be worst ,
Try only your nearest offline class , you can ask obviously , no any customer support properly, you cant even get any proper note or template for reference.
Dont waste your money
I feel same here I wate my 50000 here by doing online course. Data analysis,
They will try to convince and saying no meaning of review fake review

Rohit Reddy,"One of the courses offered by Jigsaw Academy is a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science which is a full-time 11-month course. The course is really good and offers certification from one of the top institutes in Country MAHE(Manipal Academy of Higher Education). The curriculum is also well structured and this course is a good option if you want to upskill or change domain. Here are some more features of the course

4 Industry Discussions, 5 Case Studies, 3 Assignments & 3 Industry Projects
Domain-Specific electives on Marketing and BFSI Analytics, Unstructured Data Analysis, Robotic Process Automation, and Linear Programming.
Overall, in general, the course is one of the best in India but it is a classroom module one and also full time so working professionals might find it hectic and they would have to leave the job to pursue and cope up with this course.
Also, it is very expensive @ 5 lac plus, so it is a lot of investment that’s why I would also suggest you check one other platform Learnbay. I did my Data Science certification course from here as its cheaper @ less than 1 lac but the quality of the course curriculum and their trainers were great. Here why Learnbay is recommended…
Learnbay’s DataScience & AI Course is designed for Working professionals hence he had a great amount of flexibility on timings of the batch that he can choose according to his availability.
Although he was from an engineering background his programming skills were weak but Learnbay’s program is designed in such a way that it starts from the Base/Scratch level and goes to the advanced level, also they provide extra classes to students who are not programmers.
Their instructors are not just professors but are experienced professionals in the industry. Their Instructors Are Working in Industry as AI/ML experts and are Graduates/Masters from Premier Institute like IIT/IIM and they were very supportive of any doubts that arose.
Their course fee is also relatively cheaper and very affordable @ approx 75k
But there is no compromise in the content of the course as the curriculum is well designed, up to date and in relevant with the industry standards and the course is designed in a practical approach manner with case studies, capstone projects and more
There are 15+ real-time projects that students can choose to pursue under the guidance of a trainer making him/her industry ready and getting hands-on experience and practical application
of knowledge.
Also, the program they offered is IBM Certified making it a globally recognized one.
They provide job assistance with interview training so as you will be able to crack any Data science interviews with ease.
Many of the students have been placed in the top product based MNCs like IBM, TCS, Cognizant, etc
So in all the Jigsaw courses are good although expensive, but, if you compare it with Learnbay’s IBM certified one, So, based on the good experience I had with them I would recommend you check out Learnbay.
Happy learning!"
Navonil Chatterjee,I had completed the Full Stack Data Science course from Jigsaw Academy which was really well designed keeping in mind the market requirements for the role of data analysts. The course has given me confidence to apply the positions of data analyst and crack it. I would really like to recommend this course for better market exposure.
Sachin Patil,"Jigsaw academy Course is too older. I enrolled for the Data science boot camp program and I must say it is complete wasted of Rs. 90 k money most importantly time it just give introduction every tool.
If your fresher donot go there they will not placement team will not help you and certification has no value in the Data science Industry"
Prashant Patil,"NOOOOOOOO way jigsaw is very poor at teaching .very ill planned and irrelevant teaching.i was enrolled for june 2017 batch but i found the course in context less taeching. we need some basics first and then only we can relate to any subject.
it was just like teaching english /french by reading aloud essays in language with no teaching and understanding of grammar….totally contextless..
they have invested lot in advertisement so they come first in google search and people fall trap to them. all my batchmates who enrolled alongwith me also bear same opinion."
Jatin Chakravarty,"Hi , Am a novice is Data Analytics , I have 7 years of experience in Messaging and Collaboration technologies and now planning to move to Analytics , Could some body suggest which tools i should learn , I was told by Jigsaw team to take up either R and Big data or Saas and R. Also , what would be the salary packages, I currently drew a decent salary .
Welcome your advises and Suggestion - Thanks"
Diksha Singhal,"Hey!
So, I will be coming directly to your query, as you asked about “should invest time, and money”, it is good to know you analyze your things. So, talking about Jigsaw Academy, it is a really good platform to learn.
The course content is designed to help even a beginner in this field. The content was crisp, to the point, and simple. Concepts were explained in very simple terms and the faculty chat option to resolve any queries was also great. The assignments ensured I got a feel of how real-time problems can be approached through analytics. The Course content is effective and it mainly covers the SAS section and statistics section. We get to work on real-time case studies which help to get a clear insight into the topic. The LMS system where we can find the Pre-class videos, class recordings of each class, and course material is enough to explain the concept better. Also, we can access Jigsaw Lab (Remote Desktop computer) helps to exercise our case study assignments and SAS codes as well.
You get to work on many case studies as well. The faculty and support team are very approachable and helpful in our queries. They are ready to give individual attention and follow-up of our issues.
They provide you the following courses:
Data Science course
IIM Indore program
Machine learning courses
Artificial intelligence courses
HackerU Program
Cloud computing
Cybersecurity course
PG Data Science
IoT
Big Data Courses
And more
Jigsaw is an exhilarating platform yet it is hard to get job assistance through it.
Apart from Jigsaw , there are many other good platforms like Learnbay, Simplilearn , Udemy , Upgrad, Edureka that offers some amazing and interesting courses. Learnbay( recommended) focuses on quality learning by providing industry-based learning which is cost-effective. It has highly qualified professionals striving to help the aspirants in every possible way. They also offer 15+ real-time projects and equally focus on job assistance.
Lately, you hold the decision, so choose wisely and keep learning and growing!
ALL THE BEST, Thanks for reading!"
What is your review of Jigsaw Academy?,"I choose Jigsaw academy for one of the data analyst course last year. Every single forum is saying that it was good among rest of the institute. So I choose them. I was learning Excel and SAS along with other techniques.
Excel :- I was already pro at excel, so I cleared the content easily. But their content was quite messy. They actually draft the classes/videos in untidy way. It was easier for me understand, but anyone new to advance excel can find that bit tough.
SAS and stats techniques :- Poor draft of the videos continue here as well. I was new to SAS and other stats techniques, so it was bit difficult to understand. However after learning SAS from other youtube videos. I was able to crack it.
when I was enrolled they were using WPS for teaching SAS techniques. I think now they are using SAS university edition for this. But WPS was again a headache for me.
Placement :- THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU TO GETTING PLACE. it is learning platform for a student and earning platform for them. Placement is something they actually dont understand. Forget about the placement, their placement services are pathetic. They dont even help you to write your resume or mock test.
I was in touch with them through out my course duration. Now they are complaining that my phone is not reachable for placement services.
Plus they post jobs from other employment portals. but the catch here is that they dont have jobs for freshers. Someone from data science or AI with the relevant experience is required. And most of the students are freshers, so they dont fit here. I was having experience (not in data science ) but eligible for jobs.
Please dont waste your hard earned money. it is only market gimmick."
Is it worth joining Jigsaw Academy for a PGPDM course? If not then what are the alternatives?,"I understand that this is a very difficult decision to decide as to which course to choose on for data science, machine learning and AI. I am writing this review for many of the aspiring students who ask me this question on linkedin.
Hope this helps!
As a past student and the research I did before joining this course was about the quality and quantity. Quality in terms of professors and quantity in terms of material and time.
Data Science, Machine Learning and AI being a very vast topic, does require a lot of time and learning. I had investigated some of the courses which are no doubt very cheap and the time they give is very short. I can confidently say very short as I have already done this course and have seen my colleagues doing similar kind of course but are lost. It’s so fast for them is that they are not able to understand one topic and a very big topic comes next.
The major point that I considered while perusing this course was the topics being covered and the time spent for each of them. Yes, these topics are vast and does require a lot of time and self learning, but that is not the only thing. The major plus point of this course was the people who taught us. Since for most of us this was a new topic and the major dilemma for a student to learn a new topic is the belief on what they are being taught. Why would I believe in someone who is him/herself a rookie in this field, right? As you can check the PGPD UC, jigsaw official page and can check there linkedin page as how much experienced they are what they can offer you as a professor. These professors are a well-known in name in University of Chicago and Jigsaw as well as industry in terms of guest lecturers. Why would I learn from someone who is a newbie this field, but from someone who is a learned professional and is already leading projects in this field. (I have already received some offers to be a part time trainer in some of the institutes )
Placements are part of the process for such courses and Jigsaw provides a good support for it. They do provide call from known companies from their corporate tie up and let you attend interview. I do have registered on Naukri and receive dozens of mail every day. To get job in this industry is surely not that easy and requires thorough knowledge in this subject. As from my experience, I can say that people do appreciate the courses you have done but at the end, it all drills down to you. Were you able to answer questions as per there satisfaction? If not then I don’t think any course available will help you out. At most they can help you understand the topic and clear your doubts, which I found very useful in this course."
"How was the bootcamp conducted by Jigsaw Academy? My friend recently took it up and was quite satisfied, but I need more feedback.","If you ask me to describe Jigsaw Academy in one word i would say “Incredible”. This bootcamp is worth every penny you pay. The course is fast paced, but you get to understand each and every concept clearly. The faculty at Jigsaw are really supportive and friendly, they make you feel comfortable and that makes learning process easy. Coming to the content, you have both classroom learning and online videos. The faculties explain the topics thoroughly in classroom and online videos contain clear explanations as well. If you don't understand a concept, you can raise the doubt and they repeat it right away. The structure of the course is step by step and they start from the basics and move up the ladder to advanced ones. One advantage of taking classroom learning is you get to interact with the faculty freely and clear your doubts right away and you get to meet people who are already working. As a fresher, i got to know a few people in which they shared their experience of how working environment is, and their advice will help me with future job opportunities. Coming to the support, they make you feel really comfortable and they resolve your queries quickly. You get frequent emails on job opportunities from the placement team. Like i said above, taking bootcamp course at Jigsaw Academy was an incredible experience and it's worth every penny you pay.
Thank you Jigsaw Academy
Hope it helps!!"
Is it worth taking data science course in Jigsaw Academy?,"It depends on your interest in Data analytics. If you are really invested in it, its a good start point. They help learn Machine learning basic concepts in R, such as regression, random forest, Time series forecasting. Python was rushed through. Tableau and SAS are online video walkthroughs. It has been more than 2 months since I’ve completed the course in the given assigned time(about 10% of us managed to complete it in 3 months) i.e. submission of assignments before the deadline, but that didn’t give me any bragging rights when it came to getting placed through Jigsaw(as promised before enrollment). I’m still waiting for an interview through Jigsaw that could help me land one. I will update this thread if I do get placed through Jigsaw academy."
"I am looking to enroll for a data science certification course. What are some reviews about institutes like Simplilearn, Insofe and Jigsaw Academy?","Yes, there are quite a few good institutes that provide Data Science Training, you have to do quite a good research before you enroll yourself for Data Science Training. You will have to look out for the job role which you are interested in and according to work on that.
I will review some institutes that provide Data Science Course:
Simplilearn: The program features 68 hours of in-depth learning. This is not a course most people can hit off in a single weekend or even over a single week. The course also includes four real-life, industry-based projects with corresponding demos. You can visit their website
for further details.
Jigsaw Academy: They do have different courses under this Specialization which longs from 3months to 10 months. you can choose the duration and the course accordingly. To know more visit here.
Learnbay: Learnbay is an institute that provides Online as well as Classroom training sessions. The Data Science Master's Program that they provide is a whole package that almost covers everything that is needed. They do have 12+ Real-time projects on different domains. You can visit Data Science Certification Course
for further details."
How would one compare the Data Analytics and Big Data courses at simplilearn with Jigsaw academy?,"Well on the counter part i see below grievances for Jigsaw and what matters in the end is what was the resolution and how my issue was dealt with:
Pasting few grievances from customers who are unhappy with what Jigsaw is offering:
I was planning to enrol for the Jigsaw Course on Big Data & Hadoop but initially enrolled for their short course with Jigsaw Academy on Fraud Analytics using Logistic Regression. This was to test how good is this institute and whether my investment (Rs 42k) going to be worth. Personally, I have over 10 years experience in Analytics and have used Logistic Regression several times so it was good to test them.
I found the course below average. The good parts are the SAS code, word document and their over enthusiastic pre-sales team. The good things ended pretty quickly and I was left with a poor experiencc. The instructor almost rushed through the material and didn't explain the rationale behind the steps, which was a major disappointment. Several key points prior to carrying out a logistic regression were skipped and several key checks one would carry out post logistic regression were completely missed out. The worst part was I sent over a list of questions on the video and it is 20+ days as I write this and still no response (where is their promise of quick response?).
If you are complete beginner in analytics and take this course, you may be impressed but with reasonably good experience in analytics, you will be totally disappointed. I am not sure how other online courses compare but I have seen some good stuff on Coursera/Udemy or even Youtube which are a lot better and free. So please think carefully before investing your money and time in doing courses with such institutes."
What is the main purpose of jigsaw academy? Is it fake or real?,"Jigsaw Academy teaches online courses in Data Science, Big Data, Analytics, Machine Learning. They are known to be pretty good in this section of training.
It is definitely not fake and has had numerous students take their courses and benefit from them. They have gotten some good reviews from their students as well as media houses. Go check out their website. You will definitely get better info."
How is Jigsaw Academy’s data science program?,"I am currently enrolled to their Full Stack Data Science course. Frankly, the course material and content is pretty average. They will promise big things before enrolling, but all of that is lies. I would advise people to do their homework and not get carried away by false promises from such institutes. Save your hard earned money and get more knowledge by referring to free videos and websites."
Does Jigsaw Academy provide any platform for placements to its students?,"I am 2016 student of Jigsaw. I was part of the student Whatsapp group as well. Many of my co-students kept complaining about not getting a job. I found this strange because they had not even finished one course and were talking about 7 lakh jobs. Some of them were of the opinion that they have paid the course fee and now job should come automatically.
Jigsaw LMS has many job opportunities. Some of them are valid for freshers. Others require some experience.
Jigsaw will not get you placed. They can only give you access to job openings. I also think that the changes they suggested on my resume were very good.
I think some students have unrealistic expectations. They dont want to work hard but want rewards.
Jigsaw is doing a decent job. I am happy with my experience."

      "1) I enrolled myself for Product Management PG certification and I must say that my learning has been nothing short of great. The curriculum has been one of a kind which enables working professionals to scale up and develop the skills required to go a notch above. This experience has been truly world class. I recommend this curriculum to all who are looking to learn the mantra of becoming a problem solver. The student support has been impeccable and available whenever needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) In order to explain my experience of this course i've breakdown my review into 5 major categories.\n",
      "1) Quality and quantity\n",
      "2) Student background and pace of course\n",
      "3) Online and in-person class\n",
      "4) Assignment and grading system\n",
      "5) Student and mentor relation\n",
      "So, first i'd like to emphasis on the part that due to COVID-19 situation I was not able to grab full extent of this program. And my batch suffered with the same circumstances.\n",
      "without any delay lets pick the first point \"Quality and quantity\" of this course, according to me the quality of PGPDM module is pretty amazing and simplistic if you are new in data analytics and computers field.\n",
      "You'll find no problem to understand the concept and you can easily apply all the concepts as well. Since I belong from CS background I found the quantity lil less for the money I paid.\n",
      "2) Student background and pace of course\n",
      "The dispersion of the course is extremely smooth, if you are a working buddy and still you want to make most of yourself at the weekend then you can manage your work and this module flawlessly.\n",
      "If you belong from CS background then the starting of this course will be lil boring for you, but you will definitely enjoy the in-person class.\n",
      "3) Online and in-person class\n",
      "The most amazing part is in-person class, this is the day I was waiting whole week. I was able to clear most of the doubt in these classes and also we got to know each other's potential in these classes.\n",
      "On the other hand online classes are short, mostly 2-4 hrs and if real time ques/ans is not possible, I mean not flawless like f2f interaction.\n",
      "4) Assignment and grading system\n",
      "Grading system is well mannered and I personally do not have any complain about that, although I have few suggestion to improve its efficiency. And the assignment are on weekly bases which was the best thing to keep us busy in the course. I hardly find any problem in this system.\n",
      "5) Aspirant and mentor relation\n",
      "Student and mentor relation is not extremely smooth. It is very good but not the best level. If you want grab some instant help then its not possible, plus you might have heard these lines by no. of mentors like \" I CAN EXPLAIN 100 TIMES, IF YOU WANT\", but truly no one wants to do that. Ya'know there are people from different background who find few concepts hard to understand. So yeah!!! sometimes you need to think like the way a student thinks, in order to explain.\n",
      "But all things considered they help me every time.\n",
      "NOTE: Due to COVID and some health related family issue I was not able to give my best but I did manage to make some good friends and mentors in this journey.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Jigsaw is good platform to excel your career and to learn all the trending courses. Till date my experience is good and looking forward to take more insights from Industry experts provided by Jigsaw. Academic content is up to date as per the ongoing industry standard. All the faculty members are approachable at any given point of time.\n",
      "So all the very best to the Learners out there and keep adding up your skills through Jigsaw!!\n",
      "\n",
      "4) I had enrolled for IPBA course in collaboration with IIM-I which for 10 months period, this course gives an in-depth knowledge of analytics and covers almost all the aspects of the same. The faculty is very knowledgeable and they don't compromise on the quality of the content. Student concerns are resolved within no time. The support team is great, a special thanks to Mr. Moses Kola who takes up the concerns very seriously and is very supportive throughout the course period. There are frequent sessions of open office to discuss about the issues being faced. The course is very well designed, a person enrolled should have enthusiasm to practice more and more things. The faculty will teach and guide you to the right path but you have walk on it on your own, meaning they teach you all the necessary things but you are the only person who needs to practice and learn more and ask doubts. They teach from scratch from coding to analytics and stats. There are graded assignments for every topic and practice assignments too. There is access to IIM library as well. This course is completely worry every penny. I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in pursuing analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) This course gives a great understanding of different fields in Business analytics and their applications. Faculty were good and the Jigsaw portal videos make things really simple. Some amount of dedicated time is required to pull this off though. Project coordinator - Moses, as well as other support team are quick to provide any help required.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) It's a nice place to learn Analytics, the location can't be better than this, the staff and the teaching staff is pretty friendly , the classrooms are pretty neat, everything is well organised, things happen on time ,they have lot of job opportunities, this place is surrounded by many eating options so during lunch u can go grab a quick bite and be back to study before the class starts\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Jigsaw academy is the best place to do analytics course. I was very happy that I have chosen right place to do my course. The faculty of the team very supportive and friendly that make you feel comfortable and makes learning process easy. The online classes videos are very informative, knowledgeable and easy to understand. After completion of each module the case studies and assignments section made us easy to understand. Overall they are excellent in their respective role.\n",
      "Once again I thank each and every member of jigsaw team for their support.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Bad experience with online training. After some research and review, I joined data analyst course. Before joining course, consultant from jigsaw provided good information. But after joining the program, felt like I wasted money.\n",
      "Course Structure is not as per industry.\n",
      "Faculty teaching like they are just reading some manual.\n",
      "Yes, I agree that there are some faculty who are good but sessions from such faculty was only small part and most of part covered by non experience person.\n",
      "After trying to take refund, got to know that I wasted time and it's too late to ask for refund. There is so much to write but......\n",
      "I will not recommend this institute for online training program.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Recently I have completed the PADHR course from Jigsaw. It was really very helpful and I have learned so many things which is helping me out in my current role a lot. The peers and coordinators were really very helpful and supportive…happy to be part of Jigsaw Family \n",
      "\n",
      "10) First time enrolled into the Course. With the help of Jigsaw, course industry oriented. The syllabus was up to date and well structured. Not many courses have such a vast coverage of topics, Free or paid! materials were provided; instructors are good! Placement services need a improvement! Post course data science i did i redirected to different skill which i learned earlier in my job experience not with Analytics, so you miss learning. Individual Guidance is miss this academy. Those who need step by step from starting, with guidance individual may not suit.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) The product management course collaborated with IIM is practical ,fun and the teaching is very great. It helped me transition into a PM role from developer and I started getting calls. The BYOP is soul to the whole course. It is fun learning as well\n",
      "\n",
      "12) This was my first time going into the field of Analytics. With the help of Jigsaw, my journey seemed simpler and more industry oriented. The syllabus was up to date and well structured. Not many courses have such a vast coverage of topics! Extensive materials were provided; instructors were great too! Would recommend!\n",
      "\n",
      "13) All over the course content was so informative and the hands on project which was given, made me get the practical knowledge of the concepts in whole. However I was able to attend the classes only for 4-5 months regularly due to some personal issues. Rest was all based on the course detailed videos which were uploaded on JLC. The assignments given on each concepts made me understand the particular topic thoroughly. The Jigsaw team is more supportive and responsive in all the cases except few. Faculties assigned for particular topics were clear and knowledgeable in terms of concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "14) Great course. The instructors were good and I gained a lot of value. As a CS graduate, this course gave me a lot of insight into how companies leverage CS topics such as machine learning and NLP to make business decisions. Throughout the course, Moses was of great help. He answered all my queries regarding the course and gave us students constant updates on assignment and project deadlines. Highly recommend!\n",
      "\n",
      "15) I attended this course over the period of Mid 2020 -Early 2021 .\n",
      "It was an amazing learning experience overall.\n",
      "Though there are a lot but I would say following are the few positives I would like to highlight about the course:\n",
      "1: Gives a great introduction to the world of Statistics using R& Python and to the world of Machine Learning & Data Science.\n",
      "2: Lots of hands on mini projects to hone your skills with.\n",
      "3: Takes you from beginner level Data enthusiast to Medium level Data Science Analyst by the end of the term of the course.\n",
      "4: Final Capstone project helps in using all the skills learnt throughout the course and gives a glimpse of how real time Industry projects will look like.\n",
      "As always nothing is perfect , few issues I see with the course, which i will highlight as well:\n",
      "1: Batch size is large needs to be reduced- as bigger batch size means less interaction with instructor.\n",
      "2: The process of choosing the candidates for the course needs to be stricter - lot of non-serious candidates join for just the certificate and slow down the class progress cause they never prepare and come for the classes.\n",
      "Last but not the least I would like to Thanks Mr Moses Kola who co-ordinates this program for Jigsaw academy- Moses is the most helpful person who takes care of students to the very best of his abilities, without his help I would not have completed this course.\n",
      "\n",
      "16) It was a great learning with Jigsaw Academy and they knew exactly what the employment market needed from workforce and their professional expertise has been shaping and reinventing the working individuals. There was a lot of foreseeable models had been taught by them and they are too specific on participant's needs..\n",
      "\n",
      "17) Excellent service. The entire team is very supportive special thanks to Moses Kola for constant help and support during my journey of IPBA programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "18) Three aspects and my review for them\n",
      "1) Course content - The pre class videos were more than sufficient for you to get greater understanding over the subject.\n",
      "The Live class was more of a revision/learning and clearing the concepts learnt in the pre class video.\n",
      "A suggestion to the team here would be - > If you can add some post class videos (self paced) , it can give us more insights about the subject.\n",
      "2)Jigsaw support - I would give a 5 on 5 for this facility because the very thing that anyone would want when they are stuck somewhere is assistance and all my support tickets were addressed with 24hrs and most of them within 10 hrs of time.\n",
      "3)Placement assistance - This facility only begins after we submit all our assignments and get our final certification. this ensures that we are partially eligible to start attending interviews. Resume reviews, mock interviews with the faculties and assistance before interviews is something that needs to be appreciated.\n",
      "I personally liked my duration at the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "19) Jigsaw academy is good place to learn business analytics. I have enrolled my self for its IPBA program and which is completed now few days back. Based on my experience I can say that overall its a good program for Data Scientist/ML engineers/Data Analytics aspirants. IIM professors are very good and their way of teaching is very good. Jigsaw faculty is also very knowledgeable and experienced Jitendra Manwani, Anil Parashsar are name of few.\n",
      "Real gem is our Moses Kola. He is coordinator of the IPBA program and one can contact him anytime even during late night hours. You will surely get reply. He has helped us in many ways, multiple times he helped us arranging extra sessions.\n",
      "Thanks all the faculty member of IPBA program for helping me to upskill myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "20) Jigsaw Academy is the best institute for analytics program in India. I presently enrolled in IPBA program Batch B6 of it which is offered in joint collaboration with IIM Indore. The faculties are very good in their subject and highly Qualified. Jigsaw faculties have tremendous knowledge about their subject and they also have great hands on the Industrial project. During the course you will get access to jigsaw learning portal where you will get the material for your course . Most important person in our program is Moses Kola (IPBA batch B6) who helps and guide you all through your program. At the end of the course you will get hands on to some Analytics project from Industry which is very good for Analyzing what you have studied in the course.\n",
      "\n",
      "21) Loved this course on People Analytics and Digital HR, Amazing faculty from IIM-Indore and helpful coordinators from Jigsaw Academy (Irshad Khan). I would recommend this course to every HR professional who are eager to understand and work on Regression problems for forecasting data and for finding out parameters dependent on HR metrics using statistical models. Sound knowledge in mathematics and programming would be an added advantage to learn the concepts faster in class. The syllabus is robust and holistic, which has subjects on Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Data visualization using Tableau, Regression on Python, HR concepts, to name a few. During this course of 3-4 months, you would be rated based on the projects on real time HR data, 2 graded assignments and also your attendance. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and my project with my team mates.\n",
      "\n",
      "22) The best institute I am associated with .Prof Jitendra and prof Pritam the best faculty I have ever encountered till now.They have awesome knowledge and ready to help you. There is also a Super Good guy called Moses who is a multi tasking person handling so many programs and people at a time.U ask for anything and Moses is ready to help you..All the best to them and proud to be associated with them.\n",
      "\n",
      "23) I have enrolled for PADHR Course (3rd Batch)\n",
      "The Course Material is really wonderful,\n",
      "Mentors were very helpful to complete the miles stone..\n",
      "Special thanks to Irsad & Kiran for their support.\n",
      "\n",
      "24) So it all started with an Idea of Future...Future is Data...and Data need Analysis...and I came across Data Analytics...Jigsaw has been a pioneer Brand when it comes to Data Analytics...and their Collaboration with IIM Indore has made the course desirable and attractive...My experience has been fantastic to say the least...faculties, coordinators and IT support has been Fantastic..One Long session by Mr. Jeetendra has been the best 4 hour session I have taken in my entire life...Never miss His class ...he Is in another League..Moses has been Fantastic Support and so are everyone involved in the course...If you are thinking of doing Data Analyst course..Look no further..you search has come to an end..\n",
      "\n",
      "25) Great technology backed platform for learning. One of the best in the game. And of course, the faculty is superb!\n",
      "\n",
      "26) Beware before you enrol for Jigsaw Academy. The couse materail is avaliable only till you are the active membar of Jigsaw.i.e. for 1 or 2 yrs after you pay the tution fees. After that you will not be able to go to any course videos or text material. It is total waste of money.\n",
      "\n",
      "27) I have enrolled myself for Business Analytics(IPBA program) which is a joint program run by Jigsaw Academy & IIM-Indore.My journey till date was nothing more than a roller coaster ride. Being a banker by profession this is the best program for working professionals who are interested in acquiring skills for data science and business analytics and aspire for data scientist roles as a career goal. By joining this program i learned many analytics tools which are relevant in data science field and help us analyse the data in better way. The Structure of the program is designed in such a way that it focuses on understanding the concepts of each subject and topics in detail with practicals including case study ,faculties i must say are very cooperative and knowledgeable for a program like IPBA. Yes it is a challenging course and it will take hell lot of focus and dedication such challenges have sharpened my soft skills and attention to details. Faculties like Prof Pritam Ranjan, Bhavin Shah and Jitendra Manwani are the best, i really look forward to their sessions and keep revising my topics for clarity on repeat for complete understanding of Analytics and data science concepts. They have made this program fantastic and simple with their way of teaching and with Moses as fantastic program coordinator i have always got a prompt response and support for the technical and non technical issues during program. The mechanism for resolving any issue by raising ticket helped resolving many issues. Issues such as conceptual clarity for any topic not understood, faculty member issue, Assignment issues,etc. all were being handled in smooth and hassle-free manner. Last but not the least i would thank my councillor Sampoorna for maintaining the transparency throughout the program which helped aspirant like me to take decision clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "28) I have enrolled for the Integrated program in Business Analytics (IPBA) program.\n",
      "Overview: The program is quite good if want to enter the Business Analytics field. The course gives a broad understanding of the various options and branches of the Business Analytics Field and covers all the important topics like Statistics, Time Series, SQL, Python, Machine Learning, Tableau. Everyone including non-coders can join this program. Basic programming will be taught in the classes.\n",
      "Classes are conducted during the weekend which covers the practical and theoretical concepts. If required the faculties even conduct the extra classes.\n",
      "Case Study is taken for most of the topics which gives a better understanding of the topics and a practical approach towards it.\n",
      "Also for the topics covered, at the end of every topic there will be assignment which will be either MCQ or Case Study based.\n",
      "Towards the end of the program there will be a capstone project which either the students can bring on their own or Jigsaw will provide, where everyone will be working in groups which will basically cover the things covered in the whole course.\n",
      "Also, on successful completion of the course you will be getting IIM Indore Alumni status which will be helpful for the placements.\n",
      "Faculties: There will be faculties from both IIM Indore and Jigsaw Academy. The faculties are very good and are having good industrial experience.\n",
      "Course coordinator Mr. Moses is quite helpful who is always available to sort any problems and anything we want to convey regarding the course, the faculties, arrange extra classes etc.\n",
      "Overall this course is quite good for someone who wants to switch to or enter the Data Science field.\n",
      "\n",
      "29) I am currently pursuing IPBA (Integrated Programme in Business Analytics) Program from IIM-INDORE which is delivered through Jigsaw.\n",
      "It is a great experience, however it has its ups and downs like every other course.\n",
      "They have a great supportive staff and faculty and are very prompt in answering the queries esp. Moses who is available on Whatsapp and call.\n",
      "The classes can be a bit difficult if you are not from a technical/analytical background.\n",
      "Overall great learning experience and I hope they can reach further levels by considering the feedbacks from the students.\n",
      "\n",
      "30) Jigsaw Academy is the best place to learn business analytics, as they are tied up with IIM INDORE it makes even better . I am from batch 6B [2020 -2021] of Business analytics [IPBA]. In jigsaw the response was quick and support team was really helpful , specially program manager Moses Rahul was very helpful any time you message he will reply and helped us a lot .

      "46) Hey, I did the IPBA in Batch 5, was a great course. Learnt a lot and the direction that it is going in looks very exciting. Any one interested in Data Analytics this is a premier course.\n",
      "Special shout out to Moses Kola for a brilliant work in organising the course and conducting it like a well played melody, and Jitendra Manwani for an excellent mentorship through the project\n",
      "The only feedback is to have more projects instead of tests so we learn better and have a better interaction with the course students\n",
      "\n",
      "47) I have attended the IPBA (Integrated Program in Business Analytics) offered by Jigsaw-IIM Indore in collaboration, and it has been a great journey of learning and understanding the concepts and nuances of the Data Science and Business Analytics.\n",
      "Course is a very good blend of the theory, statistics and a practical use/application of the same in the real world scenarioes. Learning Path and Curriculum designed for the course covers pretty much all the aspects of the Data Science and prepares you to work on the real-life problems at hand with much more confidence than you have had before joining the course.\n",
      "Faculties and the staff is very helpful and patient in handling multiple requests and questions that students have from time to time. Project mentor (Kiran Kumar) assigned to us for the last leg of the course (Capstone Project) helped us in understanding how to approach a problem scenario with a step-by-step process and also kept us in the right direction of the project work.\n",
      "Course coordinator Moses had been a great help in ensuring students have the right answers and support at the right time, be it any time of the day/night!\n",

      "48) Best Academy , Great Faculties , Awesome Support team\n",
      "I completed the Batch 4 of \"Integrated Programme in Business Analytics\" on Jan-2021.\n",
      "I was very new to the world of coding , but becoz of the teaching quality of the professors and the quality of course content..at no point of time I felt it was tough for me. And also the ipba support team was very active and cooperative.\n",
      "\n",
      "49) I chose this certification because of my passion for People Analytics and it has proved to be one of the best decision of my professional life.\n",
      "It really feels good to be associated with Jigsaw Academy and IIM Indore for People Analytics and Digital HR Certification.\n",
      "Faculties are truly having in-depth knowledge about the topics they teach and interpret.\n",
      "Even the support team and program manager are very agile in solving our certification related queries.\n",
      "\n",
      "50) I recently completed integrated Program in Business Analytics from Jigsaw Academy.\n",
      "Teaching experience is very good from basic to advance, I learn a lot of new technical things to improve my key skill and know how Machine learning and Big Data.\n",

      "Thank to Moses, Jitendra, and all professor to give me this opportunity to join IPBA course and IIM Indore\n",
      "\n",
      "51) I completed IPBA offered by Jigsaw and IIM Indore.\n",
      "The course was very well structured and delivered with great passion by Jigsaw and IIM-I faculties. Jigsaw LMS materials offered head start to the concepts, and with classes & projects allowing for hands-on coding on analytics and ML techniques, and detailed explanation on the topics. Data science subject is extremely vast with Statistics and algorithms having rich literature. I think the IPBA faculty team from Jigsaw & IIM-I did a great job in touching the core areas, setting in the necessary concepts and providing working demos/code for several key techniques & models, to allow one to further explore and navigate through this vast field. Throughout the course, the lectures were delivered by academicians with vast research and large-scale project experience in core subjects like statistics, rdbms systems, and big data tech. or by faculty with specific implementation experience in applying data, data science techniques and algorithms, visualizations. Attending such classes during weekends, and learning from offline videos/lecture notes through out, has probably been the best of use my weekends and spare time. Thanks to Jigsaw team esp. Mr. Moses Kola, (coordinates the program) who is always there to help and ease things out (not by moving test dates :P, but by offering positive perspective on things and his encouraging words) when the course got hectic during later half. Overall, this course is a great way to acquire analytics/ML/NLP/BI/Python/R/SQL/SQL/Spark/Tableau skills, very professionally run and offering great networking opportunities including access to IIM I faculties, industry experts in Jigsaw faculties, and peers with varied experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "52) I did my Post Graduate Program In Data Science and Machine Learning from Jigsaw Academy, the entire experience was very good. The lecturers are highly knowledgeable and quiet experienced in Data Science & Machine Learning field. They shared a lot of real time experiences as a learning to us. Program Coordinators as well were very helpful and supportive all the time. However, like the institute name goes 'Jigsaw', the course module is also like a jigsaw puzzle, the program structure are in bits and pieces, you will be confused as “where am I” and “what I’m doing” they load you with lot of assignments, which were annoying during the course but you will realize that they were the best way to learn the subject. You really need a lot of perseverance and patience towards each and every chapters in the course and wait till the end to solve the puzzle. All and all Jigsaw is a good Institute to help you excel in Data Science and Machine Learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "53) Recently I have completed my certification from IIM Indore associated by Jigsaw Academy for Integrated Programme in Business Analytics. It was a great learning platform to start a new career. By the end of this course I could see myself more potential to start my career as Business Analyst. The faculty and team members have helped me out to understand the concepts very well. Their quick response has helped me out to solve all my queries in time. This definitely levels up your career if you are determined and focused and the IIM association further increase the value. Pre-hand experience over tools like Python, R, SQL leverages your understanding and is highly advantageous.\n",
      "A good start to a great career is here...!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "54) IPBA Program is one complete package to become a Data Scientist. As suggested the market is loaded with Data science related learning platforms and institutes. Choosing one program to become knowledgeable certified candidate is challenging task. IPBA Program from IIM Indore is one amazing program covering all the core topics from scratch. I come from finance background, was not even aware about coding python, but always wanted to get into IT and future promising career. I still remember Prof Jitendra's first python class, the way he started teaching coding focusing on non-tech persons like me was amazing. IPBA program is well structured covering all the major topics.\n",
      "Thanks for Prof Harshal, Jitendra and Pritram for making all the concepts clear and giving me the apt for data science. Statistics has been always my favourite topic but the way it is applied in real business world was fantastically taught by Prof Harshal. Special thanks to our Program coordinator Moses who made everything accessible and was always there to help to solve our queries and being a great support between the department and students.\n",
      "Long story short, it was an amazing experience and journey for me, I always wanted to get in this buzz world field so called “Data science” and happy that I took up IPBA program. In such a short duration of 10-month program I consider myself well-equipped to change my career and take up a new role in this field.\n",
      "\n",
      "55) Just when the pandemic started I enrolled in this course IBPA-IIM Indore, for data analytics as I was in need of a transition to data analytics field, with the current work experience, just before completing the course. Jigsaw was able to provide me with an opportunity with a Big Four firm. This program did help me in understanding on how to progress with a Business problem and take it to the end. Would like to take this opportunity to thank the efforts of Jigsaw and IIM-Indore in making sure that we were given the required materials along with accesses. Special thanks to Moses for quick assistance on everything when needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "56) Being a Non-IT BTech Graduate, this was my entry into the IT and cyberworld. To put my experience here in a single word would be simply \"Impressive\". Together, HackerU, and Jigsaw Academy has provided a Great and Fun way of learning Cybersecurity with their Masters in Cybersecurity Program.\n",
      "\n",
      "57) A prefect academy for learning business analytics with great support from admin team and great professor!\n",
      "\n",
      "58) I recently completed integrated Program(DATA SCIENCE,IOT,BIG DATA) from jigsaw\n",
      "Jigsaw is nice place to explore Analytics World. Content Wise Courses are very good\n",
      "But i really wants to thank Soo much Support Team, Specially  Sir When any issue or problem i faced regarding LAB or Content, He immediately call & resolve problem from Both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "59) PADHR course offered by IIM Indore & Jigsaw is great start if you want to explore statistics, Data analysis, Python. Course work is good and lots of self learning material is provided as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "60) My recent experience with Jigsaw has me completely disappointed. I wanted to enroll for the full stack Java developer course. While enrolling the sales guy/student advisor-Dipanjan- was constantly following up with me about making the initial payment. So i made the payment. However, they decided to cancel the batch with no explanations and said money will be refunded in 14 days. All well and good.\n",
      "However, its been more than 3 weeks and I still don't have my money back. The student advisor when contacted, directed me to another team. I wrote to this student advisor's manager- Parvathi as well and she does not even have the courtesy to respond that they are working on it.\n",
      "I am now running around with emails going back and forth trying to get my money back. Their support team closed the ticket without resolving my issue saying- yet another team will contact me about the refund.\n",
      "This is unacceptable. I did not expect this kind of service from Jigsaw. They don't even let you sit in one demo class before committing to the course. I cannot believe Jigsaw's standards have become so low and all they want is people's money with no responsibility on following through with their promises.\n",
      "I would advise everyone to be wary of of Jigsaw and enrol at your own risk- without demo classes and there is no way of getting out once they have your money.\n",
      "\n",
      "61) I did my Full stack Data Science program which was worth to specialise oneself in the field of Data science. As a software professional, I found the course content understandable. If one student is from a non-statistics background, then we must put additional effort to understand and complete the final project as well as the viva.\n",
      "I really thank the staff and the support team for being super patient with me. They were always reachable to attend to my queries; with my own phase and time during this program journey.\n",
      "Appreciate it!\n",
      "Thank you!\n",
      "\n",
      "62) I have become passionate about product management and always want to build my profile around it. I have been searching for a perfect course which can help me upskill in this domain and finally found one.\n",
      "Currently pursuing Product Management from IIM Indore & Jigsaw Academy.\n",
      "Sometimes you will be lost during the course as there are lot of things to do thats where kanti from support team comes in. Support is excellent. For anything and everything I am able reach out to the SPOC and get my queries clarified. Keep it up!\n",
      "\n",
      "63) I had enrolled myself in Full Stack Data Science program. The support is very cooperative.. The course is designed for everyone for IT or non IT people. The faculties are so very supportive that whenever I questioned them they answered me at the earliest. As well as the the live classes were so helpful. Overall my experience is very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "64) Course content of good..but as far as placement is concerned ,they do nothing. I completed two courses from Jigsaw ,data science for beginners and data science with R. But after completing course few months after I contacted for placement. Many times they asked me to update my CV and send back. After sometime mock interview was contacted but it was just a joke..after asking some stats formulas I was asked I need to learn more although I m doing freelancing on same and did many projects. After that I didn't get any response from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "65) Hi,\n",
      "I just completed my Post Graduation program in Data science and machine learning form Jigsaw academy last month. The content provided in this course is really good. Though i am from non IT Background I am able to learn faster as the course is designed as if we can learn form a very basic level to advanced level. The support provided from lecturers and mentor's was very helpful even in this pandemic situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "66) Hi Folks\n",
      "I have completed my post graduate on cloud computing from manipal University.\n",
      "And to say the experience and the learning path is really good\n",
      "And the faculties are friendly and help us on the career path. And the learning path is really flexible.\n",
      "\n",
      "67) I had taken two courses from Jigsaw, Big Data Specialist and Full Stack ML and AI. For both the courses, I got plenty of support from the faculty and support team. The course content was also good and the evaluation equally tough.\n",
      "\n",
      "68) I am currently pursuing People Analytics and Digital HR course. Very well structured course modules that are detailed yet precise. Wonderful place for acquiring knowledge that can actually be used. My special thanks to Mrs. Kanti Shetty for her continuous support.\n",
      "\n",
      "69) Its a great place to learn and get practice on full stack developer, it provides you to get good experience to code with real time projects.you will be able to learn from scratch to high level program which is done in company level.\n",
      "\n",
      "70) It's a great pleasure to learn from HackerU. Jigsaw academy created a such fantastic platform to learn cyber security by collaborating with HackerU. Best faculties with very much friendly behavior with professionalism. One of the India's finest cyber security courses. But do not know about the placement.\n",
      "\n",
      "71) Master Certification In Cyber security (Red Team) is a good start for any one who want to start their career in cyber security.Organized course structure with interactive teaching methodology.\n",
      "\n",
      "72) Master Certification In Cyber security (Red Team) is a good start for any one who want to start their career in cyber security.Organized course structure with interactive teaching methodology.\n",
      "\n",
      "73) You will have a contact person only until you pay full amt. Once after that, nobody is going to help with your issues. They write their own reviews, don't get deceived by reviews on Analytics magazine, as they own it. With the increased demand in Analytics course, the best faculty has moved out, I guess, so they give the job to trainees to teach us. Horrible experience.\n",
      "My jigsaw ID:Jig19876\n",
      "\n",
      "74) \"Master in Cyber Security (Red Team)\" is one of best course to kick start their career in Cybersecurity right from the basics to a real time offensive penetration tester (RED Team) along with the kind and highly skilled trainers and staff who would always be ready to help anytime.\n",
      "Thank you HackerU_India Jigsaw_Academy\n",
      "\n",
      "75) I was one of the students in the latest batch its been a very good , very informative, and the bootcamp session will give you hands on experience and the practise you need and i could say its been a wonderful 5 months and very interesting..\n",
      "\n",
      "76) I completed my course in March and luckily in the next month I got opprtunity to move to analytics department in our bank. Great teaching material they provide.\n",
      "Regards\n",
      "Kiran SH\n",
      "\n",
      "77) Very Cooperative team.... Faculty are always up for any Query...... Better platform to learn than others... Online classes are the best thing about this course where we can ask ample amount of questions.\n",
      "\n",
      "78) A few weeks back, I completed my Post Graduate Program In Data Science and Machine Learning from Jigsaw Academy. The entire experience has been fantastic and eventful. The professors/lecturers were all well versed with their subject and they were readily available & helpful. Even though the program was really hectic,\n",
      "demanding, sometimes nerve breaking, but the entire journey has been a wondrous one. The Academy provided us with extra classes as and when the position needed.\n",
      "One need to serve plenty of assignments which will certainly give sleepless nights in days and weeks, but there is a sense of achievement after going through this struggle. For me, Jigsaw Academy is certainly synonym of the word \"trust\". Especially,\n",
      "I want to mention two names, Mr. Dipyaman Sir, for aiding us with our Capstone Project, and Mr. Irshad our coordinator, many times helping us out of the path.\n",
      "\n",
      "79) People Analytics and Digital HR program is timed very aptly when we, HR professionals are at the inflexion point of leveraging technology like never before to manage people remotely due to COVID19. This 3 months course gives a very good insight of usage of various Data Visualisation as well as Analytics Tools. The pedagogy of faculty at IIM Indore as well as Jigsaw has made the subject very interesting and easy to understand. Overall a very satisfying experience of learning from the premier institution like IIM Indore and Jigsaw Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "80) Any one looking to begin their Data Science journey Jigsaw Academy is that place to be.\n",
      "Great support team & Faculty, help to develop a competitive edge with a well designed curriculum flexible enough for working professionals.\n",
      "\n",
      "81) It was one of the best training that I have attended so far. The two important things that you should have, to succeed and sustain in this domain are desire and passion\n",
      "Checkout the course modules first, you will receive hands on practice in almost all the concepts. Industry experts will be training and monitoring you in this course.\n",
      "Nothing in this world is perfect, you might have ups and downs while learning or practicing, just NEVER GIVEUP. Worrying abou job? Nobody in this world can guarantee a job for you, if you don't have self-confidence and subject knowledge. Don't worry, if you don't have a technical degree/ experience, it doesn't really matter. You can still learn and grab a job with decent package.\n",
      "Be prepared for everything, everyday will be like a challenge. Focus to what you interested more in this course, and gain knowledge on all other concepts.\n",
      "Note: This is neither an endorsement nor recommendation by me for Jigsaw Academy. Purely personal experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "82) The course master's certificate in cybersecurity(Red team) was a good structured course overall and a good starting point for anyone interested in cybersecurity, the faculty from HackerU structured and taught the course as effieciently as possible with the student in mind.\n",

      "~got placed as cyber security consultant.\n",
      "\n",
      "84) Jigsaw actually helped me a lot in getting good knowledge on the subject(Theoretical, coding, presenting) … I was a person who was “Zero” in coding before i got in there, now that i have completed the course i feel good about my coding abilities the reason for that is they teach us from that zeroth point . We have access for video content along with the in person classes where we always had a reference to what we learnt in class. After completing the project with their assistance I have gained more practical knowledge. Over all a very good experience.\n",
      "I would like to thank Jigsaw for all the support they gave me. Happy to be a alumni of Jigsaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "85) After doing much research on the best analytics coaching institute in Bangalore, I joined jigsaw academy boot camp classroom program.\n",
      "The sessions were very informative and eat too understand. Doubts were cleared and the concepts were made easier to understand. I would recommend this institute for any working professional or a fresher.\n",
      "Real time examples were given in explaining each concept. Timely quizzes were conducted and the videos were extremely helpful. They even offer 100% placement assistance with mock interviews and Viva.\n",
      "The support from the team was good. As a working professional and a student of jigsaw, I am happy with the data science boot camp classroom program which I opted. It's worth!\n",
      "\n",
      "86) I did Full stack data science program with Jigsaw academy. To begin with, First their content is very good for beginner to start with.Their teachings and explanations are too good. Second is the value for money ,They did justice to the money i spent i'm totally satisfied with the content.\n",
      "Next to talk about is their mentors , I did online classes with them so its very fast paced so most of the time i needed help they supported me through out the course. Help and support team attended every query of mine immediately. Their placement team was also very helpful.\n",
      "I learnt Tableau,R,python and statistics from the course I highly recommend this course if your planning to switch over to data science.They provide everything for you to begin with. Real time projects and mostly those assignments will make sure you learn everything.Apart from this their external sources they provide will lend you hand at times when you struggle.So thanks Jigsaw .\n",
      "One humble request , i would suggest a update to the topic related to machine learning in python. It had a good content i'm not denying that but a deeper reach out and explaining about all the other algorithms ,regularization, cross validation would be good for beginners to lean.\n",
      "Thank you for the amazing learning experience!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "87) After going through web reviews, I enrolled for Full Stack Data Science program at Jigsaw Academy. Videos, transcripts and assignments are quiet useful for a good start in the field of Data Science. What specially I liked about the course is Capstone project and Viva process which makes person understand the concepts thoroughly. Support faculty is very helpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "88) Jigsaw academy's Data Science program is a excellent course that a person absolutely needs to taken if they are interested in Data Science, they have hit a perfect balance in the course were it teaches the basics of Data Science and also Dips into the expert level without losing sight of the students capacity.\n",
      "The support staff ( Especially Giriprasad M ) are experts so know the ins and outs of the course and are willing to help with students needs.\n",
      "The Faculty depends on the course u to take and Data science faculty were good at put concepts across and helping us understand and learn core concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "89) Hello All,\n",
      "Let me share my inputs and comments about my stint at Jigsaw Academy as a student and it is going to be a slightly lengthy post as would like to cover esentially some finer details.\n",
      "I was a part of the Comprehensive Bootcamp program in 2018 and probably one of my pivotal decisions towards shaping my career.\n",
      "After 18 years of work and not sure of the next BIG leap to take, you tend to ask questions about \"What Next\", \" Why this\" or \"Why that\", etc....I was going through the same situation and that's when after completing Online certification in R in 2017 and doing some work on Analytics within my domain, I realised that Online education can only help me get this far but what I needed were 2 things :\n",
      "1) A classroom setting and\n",
      "2) Emphasis on learning how to apply Data Science to solve real world problems.\n",
      "With that thought, I started speaking with various institutes, and finally zeroed in on Jigsaw...\n",
      "At that time, I found some interesting things about them.\n",
      "1) They were Education/Knowledge partners with IIMB at one point in time and\n",
      "2) My company endorsed them and we had our Sr. leadership also give Talks periodically.\n",
      "After joining the instititute, what I liked best about them was their teaching methodology. There emphasis was never on learning how to cod, or to just learn Python or R etc, but was on developing your fundamental way of thinking or what I would call the \"Basics of Data Science\"..We had multiple classes on Hypothesis testing, understanding not only what Regression is but the applicability of those techniques in the real world..\n",
      "Mayukh Ghosh was awesome. He taught exactly the way I wanted a teacher to. Not to focus on coding only but on the applicability on it...\n",
      "He always had an answer with examples on Regression, Classification and my favourite of all \"Time series\"..\n",
      "Mayukh has a gift. he could decide to be an acamedician in one class or could alienate completely in another one if he felt the group is ready to get into a working session...\n",
      "A thorough gentleman who knows his craft well.\n",
      "Kunaal Naik was also a lot of fun. His session on ML with Python was to be honest quite taxing because of the time issue but was very informative..His sessions were more hands on and I wished we could spend more time learning more on Random forest and Decision trees etc.\n",
      "But the 1st class was probably the best not only because it was an Ice breaker or rather going back to the calssroom after 18 years but the session was very nice. Mahesh was the Instructor and covered Advanced Excel and I learnt a lot inspite of using Excel for so many years.\n",
      "Overall, post completion and the Capstone Project, I was able to get into the Advanced Analytics team within my company and today lead a team of Data scientists and BI experts building and enhancing Cognitive Analytical solutions to help solve process issues for my clients and also to making processes Smarter.\n",
      "I would like to conclude that Learning is a journey and is neverending but my stint with Jigsaw truly enabled me to take the Plunge and make a Mid career switch into Analytics..\n",
      "All the Best.\n",
      "\n",
      "90) After a lot of research, I got to know about Jigsaw Academy from Analytics India Magazine. I am currently pursuing the Full Stack Data Science program which is an Instructor-led program. The course is very well designed.\n",
      "They practically groom you.\n",
      "Faculty is also supportive especially Kafeel Sir who has helped me a lot in solving all my doubts.\n",
      "Support Team is also very helpful in solving all the queries.\n",
      "I will highly recommend this institute for whoever wants to take up their course.\n",
      "\n",
      "91) Recently, I completed my FSDS program from Jigsaw Academy. Firstly, I had tried to learn on my own by watching multiple videos on Youtube and other sites. But it was difficult to get a flow. Finally, In Jigsaw, I got the excellent content to learn Data science and that too in a step by step approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "92) Hi,\n",
      "I’ve recently finished full stack data science program by Jigsaw Academy. I have studied Automobile engineering + Management, with no experience of coding whatsoever, currently working with JSW steel in channel sales. I had a couple of subjects on business analytics and BI during MBA wherein I had gotten a flavour of what analytics is and when I was looking to upskill in this particular area I came across Jigsaw academy’s NASSCOM certified online program. It was instructor led, every weekend 3hrs session each.\n",
      "I would highly recommend the program for anyone who wants to start from scratch, here’s a list of few things that I really liked about the program:\n",
      "1. Breaking down of concepts: The faculty was really amazing and he broke down every machine learning concept and explained it step by step so simply and with such depth that one would develop a natural intuition for understanding of those algorithms. We would understand everything from the point of view of Mathematics, graphical understanding, intuition, coding and finally the business application.\n",
      "2. Even though I didn’t have any prior experience of coding, it was taught from basic and for every algorithm we would do real time practice for coding the same. By the end of the curriculum, I was able to code in both R and Python efficiently.\n",
      "3. One of the biggest advantage for instructor led class v/s MOOC is the doubt clearing sessions, for any assignments that you have, can always raise a ticket and doubt was resolved within hours!\n",
      "Probably the only suggestion from my side to further improve the program would be inclusion of couple of more algorithms such as SVM, Monte Carlo, light boost, xgboost etc. And also Tableau was self paced, perhaps they can include a live lecture on that as well…and those students who done FSDS, they can perhaps provide a cheaper Deep Learning add on course.\n",

      "Reply for what you commented :- The Phases was not taken in-person, stop lying and calling it as false allegations. As you stated that you changed the faculty due to covid-19, Government of India didn't place any rule stating that Israel's faculty can't teach Indian students on an online platform due to covid-19. If your reply was true then I even spoke with the batch 1 students (which was held almost 3months prior to covid-19 pandamic), they also told me about how you guys changed the instructors. Coming back to the feedback, I'm also in the same batch and have friends in it too. I know what the feedback is .\n",

If you think what I posted is not true and making false allegations on your institute then you can legally take action on me.\n",

The case studies and assignments are really helpful to gain knowledge.I finished the data science course in 8 months. And just after finishing it,I got an Internship opportunity from Jigsaw in a Marketing Analytics Company in Bangalore with some kind of job assurance as per my performance in the internship period. Some feedback I would like to share that- the python course can be bit more informative. There should be a capstone project in python. Implementation of decision tree in SAS would be a good option and also some algorithms like KNN,random forest,bagging,boosting,stacking,K fold cross validation can be included in R. Faculties are good. Promptness in response to the tickets from the faculties, is average. Placement support is very good. I managed to get 3 jobs till date out of 20 interviews they provided. I am discarding 1 star because I think quality of python faculty can be better. Otherwise jigsaw is very good and highly recommended.\n",

These people are very unprofessional.Earlier,I had a positive image of this institute, however, the desperateness of their counselors shows that all they care about is money.They even say that now is the best time to learn data since because of high paying job.I wonder is money is all we need? in an other words :Is the only unique selling point of the course is money?\n",
      "I wanted to go for this course as it doesn't require you to have a high end computer to work with huge data as the institute has cloud based platform that allows you to work on data even on a low performing system.I also saw the value that it has made the course for great lake college so it must have some quality content and authoritative knowledge about the data field.I was almost all set to enroll unless over the past few weeks I called insofe and changed my mind to go for certification course with them that's when the true color of this institute came out.The rep was curt and she wasn't as nice to me as she was earlier.She could have pitched me her university of Chicago certificate course,however, she was so pissed off that covert anger and target driven attitude became apparent.I felt very bad with the conversation I had with her.I even sent an email to the institute, telling them act rationally and professionally and that don't make your counselors act like typical business developers , however,I didn't get any response from them.Not even an acknowledgement.That says a lot about this institute.An educational institute that doesn't even believe in open written communication how can they fulfill the they promise made while enrolling student.I won't talk about the content as I have not studied at jigsaw but definitely what good are content when the approach is unprofessional.\n",

      "284) I have more than 20 years experience in IT Infrastructure, not much exposure to coding. I was looking for upskilling myself with new technology, then I came across Jigsaw Academy via Google search and enrolled for IOT (Internet of Things) full stack program including IOT Analytics. Jigsaw IOT Full stack course is well designed course and gives full understanding of course. All video topics, bonus topics on JS coding, Case study workshops and webinar recordings are very well covered. Jigsaw Faculty and support team are very well supportive and provide resolution for all my queries regarding course topics and sometimes they conduct workshops with new technologies out of box. I am really enjoying learning with this course and recommend others too. Thanks\n",

      "285) My brother suggested me to join Jigsaw Academy as I wanted to shift my career from IT to Analytics and It was an excellent decision of joining Jigsaw Academy. Being an Engineering graduate with Computer Science as background was of course a little bit hard to understand the statistical concepts and make Business sense out of it. But Jigsaw Academy have just simplified it. I have enrolled for their Foundation course in Analytics, which is the base course for Analytics. The case studies which they cover during the class is very realistic which will help you to understand the raw data much better. The entire Foundation course is designed in such a way that it would help any fresher to build up strong basics in analytics. One of the key advantage of joining Jigsaw Academy is that you will have access to the remote server where you can practice on the case studies. The Faculties are exceptionally good with experienced people around and on other hand the support team is one of the best customer service team I have seen so far. They answer your queries within short period of time. Jigsaw Academy also assists students in getting placed in companies after the completion of the course. Hoping to get placed soon after the completion of the course. I would definitely recommend this course to anybody who is planning to switch their career to analytics. My Best wishes to the Jigsaw Team! Happy Learning!\n",

      "\n",
      "287) I have completed few courses in Jigsaw Academy. Analytics for Leaders is one of the best course I have done in Jigsaw which suits for Middle level Managers and Management executives. The explanation of real time case studies was awesome which covers the Various business domains of the industries. Hats off to you JIGSAW !!!\n",
      "\n",
      "288) Well Supported team members and the Faculties. I had completed the Data Science With R Course. It was a good experience for me to learn at my own pace. Course contents are good and easy to understand and learn.\n",
      "Thanks to Divya Anand & Chandhan for supporting words, appreciated their quickness in replies for the raised ticket and making sure that the query is resolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "289) I enrolled in Jigsaw's \"Full Stack IoT Program\". I have completed the first half of the course with certification from Jigsaw. It can be verified in my LinkedIn profile. I am extremely pleased that I made the decision to learn about IoT from here as compared to anywhere else. The reason being that every theoretical concept is complemented with a hands-on practical implementation along the way. The hardware needed for all the projects was provided within days of enrolling in the course. There are capstone projects at the end of every module which accumulate the knowledge learnt over the entire module. The faculty is excellent in clearing doubts in a clear manner and more importantly in a timely manner which is important for any online training course. They went beyond what might have been required for clearing doubts and explaining concepts, providing links for further reading if required. The faculty contact according to our timing as I have a working job as well. The technical team have always responded by fixing any issue which arose within a few hours and sometimes within less than an hour. All that being said, the real strength of Jigsaw's IoT program lies in the fact that it exposes the student to so many new technologies which are necessary to understand and implement in the IoT eco-system other than the core domain knowledge; even if they might appear as not being relevant immediately. Such technologies are the MEAN stack, Blynk mobile app, containers(Docker), TICK stack, facial detection, speech recognition, AWS's EC2 instance for cloud to name a few. There is also documentation for reference for all the practicals. That being said, it is up to the student if they want to dive deeper into each topic on their own time. There are also workshops for each module which augment to the knowledge further. IBM Watson is introduced in one such workshop. The placement team update the student forum with up-to-date job listing which are relevant for the IoT domain. The course is well-designed may it be graphics for visual style of learner or description for verbal style of learner. The graphics and the icons meant to communicate concepts are unlike anywhere I have ever seen in any presentation or video. They immediately make the concept stick as a image in the mind; which is very helpful to recall later. The depth with which they were designed is indeed marvellous. Not many pay such attention to such minor details; unless it is Apple Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "290) The Machine Learning course offered by Jigsaw is excellent, content and the faculty support is really good. It's very easy for a person who is new to machine learning to upgrade the skill set by the courses offered by Jigsaw Academy.\n",

      "302) I have attended two analytics courses on Coursera before this course and there is no comparison between MOOCs and Jigsaw Academy's course. it is miles ahead.\n",
      "Here are the things I liked -\n",
      "1. I found that being able to chat with the faculty through the day was very helpful. I took their help whenever I got stuck anywhere.\n",
      "2. The quality of videos is pretty good as well.\n",
      "3. The virtual lab is the most useful part of the course. I enjoyed working with business data here.\n",
      "Things I didn't like -\n",
      "1. I found the pace to be hectic. i was expected to put 8 to 10 hours every week which was difficult for me.\n",
      "2. the \"chat with instructors\" option was very very helpful. But it was introduced towards the end of my course. :(. This feature makes the course even better.\n",
      "3. The access to videos is limited to 6 months. I t will be better to get lifetime access.\n",
      "\n",
      "303) I was at first reluctant to join an online course, but when I talked to their counseling faculty all my doubts were cleared. Finally I am a student of Jigsaw and yes the course is up to the mark with industry experts teaching you. The case studies in my course are real time and I am happy about it. Hope to master the Analytics Domain soon.\n",

Their study material is extremely good and gives a strong foundation about Analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "311) DATA Science course with SAS is a very informative course which gives basic level understanding of DA. Special mention for case studies. Those are really helpful. Content is very relevant and well explained.\n",
      "On the flip side, it is quite difficult and cumbersome to work on remote server and LMS. Data is not allowed to be exported outside..not even contest data which reduces the likelihood of participants to work on problems.\n",
      "Most of the trainers are knowledgeable but not that helpful with the exception of few such as Mayukh. He was very helpful and helped me in clearing doubts.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "318) Very poor service,along with me and my friends registered this course of more then 50k INR but not worth to join specially who want to know the in and out of big data and data science. There are other good training institute like Coursera, simplylearn would be better then this program style. I`d not recommend this course for fresher who simple need more package to switch their career to analytics, secondly its not worth joining for working professional who are expecting to freeze their course in between as Jigsaw only gives self learning video once you are out of continuous session series out from your assign batch. The video access is not a life time, you have to pay for the videos once your course duration is expire, Be aware!\n",
      "\n",
      "319) I am a student doing a course titled \"Data Science in R and SAS.\" Student support executives Naveen and Chandan have provided me all the assistance I asked for. In fact, Naveen used to call me every week regarding the status of my course and he also told me that to complete SAS before starting R. The support you get from JIgsaw Academy team is simply superb. Best wishes for Naveen and Chandan and the support team. This is not a fake review.\n",

      "I was then offered the Data science with R course for free to make up for this which was great on their part.\n",
      "Would recommend the SAS or R course which I think was excellent in content and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "322) It is really worth investing your money here , each penny you pay is worth enough , you have to research a lot before you submit your assignment which helped me in gaining more knowledge , Thanks to Moses for a single point of contact in resolving all the technical issues which i faced till date .thank you so much jigsaw for helping us in building our career path towards Analytics\n",

      "\n",
      "333) Referring to the post by Anit Antonito, I would like to highlight some points about my experience with Jigsaw Academy.\n",
      "I have taken all the 3 courses SAS, R, and Python. I believe that all 3 have their own place in the analytics arena today. Companies in different domains have different requirements and it helps to be well prepared if one is looking out for analytics jobs as a fresher or looking to change streams in mid-career.\n",
      "First and foremost, let us face the fact, no one can assure you a job, they can only help you prepare for it. Each one needs to invest their time and effort to complete all the courses\n",
      "I have been a student at Jigsaw Academy for the last one year and very satisfied with my investment in the program.\n",
      "Jigsaw Academy conducts a lot of activities over and above the course delivery to add to your analytics acumen. Apart from the easy to understand course materials and good faculty support, they conduct monthly contests which give you a taste of the real-world challenges. Relevant post and updates about the developments in data science on Forums and Blogs.\n",
      "Regular sessions with industry mentors to help you sharpen your skills. I have attended a couple of these webinars and they are excellent! Weekly jobs post from within their corporate network and from others job portals.\n",
      "Currently, I am in the process of finding a job, being from a different domain it is difficult but not impossible. Jigsaw mentors advised me to solve as many case studies as possible and maintain a GitHub profile which is helping me to get shortlisted. Also, the placement team at jigsaw has been forwarding my resume to their connections.\n",
      "Thanks to Jigsaw for helping a non-programming background, MBA Finance graduate to transform into a new age data analytics professional.\n",
      "\n",
      "334) its a decent Institute to learn analytics.I have undergone the data science specialisation course which provides you basic knowledge about various methods used in analytics.The support team is good and always helpful to solve your queries.The Placement assistance Team help you in building your resume and giving referral to various companies who approach the institute But Cracking the Interview is all upto you .I got successfully placed\n",
      "in one of the companies they referred .Thank You Jigsaw Academy for your support\n",
      "\n",
      "335) I have enrolled for 4 courses in Jigsaw Academy. The course content is designed in such a way to give the overall understanding of the particular course. With many real time examples given in class videos and hands-on lab session makes it a great deal to learn analytics from Jigsaw Academy.\n",
      "The course content is provided with pre-class videos and pre-class materials which covers almost all the basic things needed for that particular class (Both Web based & Instructor led classes).\n",
      "The faculty for the courses are knowledgeable and the interaction with faculty & support team is seamless in getting the issue resolved (whether it is related to subject/topic or general support). It just doesn’t stop with videos and materials. The Case Study will make us utilize all the knowledge gained and understanding the topics learnt. The case studies are designed in such a way to give the real-time experience in Analytics. The Forum or Discussion board makes the students to interact among themselves.\n",
      "I would say that anyone who can sufficiently devote 2-3 hours per day or a minimum of 10 hrs per week can complete the course on time balancing the professional and personal duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "336) The course is well articulated, starts with basics so even a non-statistic student can get the pace and move on to understand the how analytics works by doing good case studies. Even faculties are well expertised in this field, support and online chat options are well appreciated!\n",
      "\n",
      "337) i ve been with jigsaw enrolled into data scientist and retail analytics, i found that the tutors are very supportive and intuitive. the course content is so well organised even though i'm totally new to the subject i never had any difficulty in learning, with the virtual class rooms one can replay the class session if any question arises besides there is always a support team to handle all the concerns\n",

      "Gaurav and Sarita are great mentors and extremely responsive. Not only did I sharpen my technical and problem solving skills under them ,by joining Jigsaw I had entered an ecosystem- where Gaurav/Sarita and my other peers at Jigsaw were a forum I could look up to when I wanted to deliver something better at my work and needed guidance.\n",
      "It gave me an opportunity to utilize the \"crowd wisdom\" of this set of people containing experienced biggies like Gaurav/Sarita but also my parallels who working else where in analytics. Overall, if you want to get into analytics/ do well in analytics - don't look at Jigsaw as just one course- look at it like joining an ecosystem. This ecosystem will help you drive your growth in analytics for years to come.\n",
      "\n",
      "341) Doing the Foundation Course at Jigsaw Academy was a fantastic experience. The programme is very well designed to combine statistical concepts with analytic techniques using the language of SAS. The course provides a framework within which one can develop his/her thinking on any key analytic business challenge with a view to identifying the right solution.\n",

      "Ram Bhargav\n",
      "\n",
      "343) I had enrolled for the Foundation Analytics (SAS) course in Dec 2013. As far as pedagogy, course content and delivery is concerned Jigsaw Academy is definitely top-notch. The instructors were extremely prompt in their email responses to queries and doubts. If you diligently complete the mandatory assignments, there is no doubt that you will gain a solid foundation in Statistics and Analytics techniques as well as good, functional familiarity with programming languages and tools.\n",
      "If I have to nitpick, the only disappointment was not having lifelong access to the course notes and assignment solutions, but I believe that issue has been fixed now.\n",
      "I would definitely advise any mid career professionals seeking to switch to Analytics related roles to surely connect with Gaurav or Sarita to understand which course options would be ideal for them.\n",

      "Education: All are recorded videos but the good part is you get opportunity to work in a SAS and R platform through remote connection. coming to Interview questions and capstone project, they ask to refer books but I don't know what is the use of Jigsaw if we refer books.\n",
      "Placement: Asked to complete the courses to refer any company. before this they ask to apply for Internships which cannot be shortlisted. The beauty part is they send the naukri and IIM job portals vacancies on SAS/R/Python\n",
      "This is the true fact of Jigsaw.\n",

      "352) Hi All,\n",
      "I am writing this review after the completion of 2 courses that I did From Jigsaw Academy. “Data Science with R and Big Data.” Before Starting the review I will like to tell you about my technical background. At the time of joining the course I had around 3 years of experience as Oracle PL/SQL Developer.\n",
      "After reading and listening much about analytics I finally decided to look for Institutes that provides courses in Analytics. If you search on google you will find Jigsaw on top 5. Before going to Jigsaw I Checked Online fee structure of various institutes for big data course. Mainly Fee structure varied from 25K to 30K Max. But when I went to Jigsaw I was surprised to hear the fee structure that was costing almost 2 to 2.5 times what other institutes were charging. I asked them the reason for this and the guy said the quality of assignments, videos and dataset set they provide for work are really good.\n",
      "Please not the point that the fee structure I am talking about is for self-learning Course, which means you will be provided with a set of videos of each topic which you have to see and give assessments after each topic. If you go for Instructor led course which means you have a live class with the tutor once in a week that will cost you very high. Please note the course fee is not fixed and it depends how much you can bargain or any offer they provide.\n",
      "After thinking a lot I went for Combination of 2 Courses Data Science with R and Big Data Course. After negotiation finally the guy offered me the course for 56K. Course validity was for 1 year.\n",
      "Now I will give you little Introduction about Each Course.\n",
      "Data Analytics with R: In this Course you will be learning About Machine Learning Techniques and how to implement it to solve business problems. The Course start with very basic and covers all the topics that you need to learn to be a Data Analyst. This is a new thing if you are not from statistics background. You have to be very patient and hard working to learn Data Analytics.\n",
      "Big Data: I will say this course is best suited for Database related people, as it has DB Concepts involved into it. I would recommend people who are working in Database to go for this course instead of going for combination of both. This course covers almost all the topics involved in Big Data Concepts.\n",
      "Please Note after completion of course you will stand somewhere between basic and intermediate level for the course you are learning. This level can Change depending on your practice and hardwork.\n",
      "Placements: Here comes the most important part. Will I get a job after completing the Course? Well it depends on various factors. You’re Salary, Experience, whether company is willing to take a student only with Certification but no with hands on Experience.\n",
      "Most of the Companies that comes to Jigsaw are startups. Few big names also came like OFSS, Genpeck etc. I have given 2-3 interviews from Jigsaw, But the major concern of the companies is whether you have hands on experience of the same in your current role or not.\n",
      "So Thinking that you will get a job after completion of course is not an easy thing. You have to make sure that you solve some real word problems on different web sites and put in your resume to make sure that recruiter takes interest in you.\n",
      "In the end I would like to say that Content of Jigsaw is good, but the fee is very high. For the Big data course I checked Eureka videos or some YouTube videos I found similar kind of content on them also. So I felt they are charging high. If you see the Eureka fee structure you will get to know how much difference is there.\n",
      "So far I have not got a job on the course I did. The two reasons I felt is:\n",
      "1.)No Hands on Experience in my current role.\n",
      "2.)Current Salary.\n",
      "All the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "353) Great support from the Jigsaw team. The HR analytics course is good with useful examples and case studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "354) Really helpful , knowledgeable faculty and backend support system which has made my journey into Sas & R a breeze, looking forward to doing more specialisation courses with Jigsaw. Extremely happy with my decision to have enrolled with Jigsaw Academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "355) Hi, please give your sincere feedback regarding this Academy, because i'm totally confused with the below reviews. I'm a non-programmer guy with good academics who would like do an Analytics Course (R, SAS and Python) from Jigsaw Academy. I have six years of experience in Aerospace industry, currently working with one of the Indian MNC, kindly let me know if Jigsaw is the right place to learn analytics with zero programming knowledge. Is it okay if I go with the pre-recorded room training or for a non-programmer guy like me needs an Instructor led training?? I have the ability to understand the things fast...\n",

      "362) Hi All,\n",
      "A collection of all sorts of analytic's courses which Jigsaw provides along with the faculties who are having very good real time experience makes Jigsaw exception platform .It has helped me understanding the real meaning of Analytics and has also me to realize the importance of it across industries. The portable nature of classes along with a very interactive learning of the tools like SAS etc which are the market leaders has really turned me on to join the course. Unlike other institution they had also given me a chance to undergo the first classes free of cost and it helped me to gain confidence whether join the classes or not and to realize my comfort zone with the on line classes. In addition to the very well information that they would provide during the classes , Jigsaw would also share good materials and their real time implementation of analytics across the corporate. One more better part of Jigsaw is that for the classes that we have missed they would again give us the opportunity to cover up by providing the same or better faculty . One of the best and foremost features of Jigsaw and its employees are they are very responsive in nature and treat their students very friendly. Overall i would advise a student who is about to start his carrier in Analytics Jigsaw would be best platform. Thanks a lot to Gaurav sir & Sarita mam for initiating such blend of online data analytics course which has helped the students to excel their carrier into analytics. My special thanks to Moses who was very supportive and a quick resolver for any technical challenges which we have come across throughout the courses. My best wishes to Jigsaw Team..Cheers, Shishir\n",

Faculty are expertness on the theme they've Blackbeard us by using real-prison term examples. At every instance they are there for us no topic it's a weekend or a vacation too. If in future Jigsaw come up with a course on \"How to provide table serving to the client's\" or \"Service to the Customer Analytics\". I would be the first person to enroll into the course.

      "\"If customers gets 99 meter s goodness service and 100th meter it's ok or bad service customers remembers last service only.

      "367) William Arthur Ward said \"Feeling gratitude and not expressing it, is like wrapping a present and not giving it\" and I agree.\n",
      "I would like to express my gratitude to Jigsaw Academy and to all the staff members. Jigsaw Academy is a very good institution those who want to study analytics. It is because of the course and also because of the teaching and non teaching faculties. They have been very supportive throughout the tenure of the course. They were always there to guide each and every step of the course. They were ready to teach and explain same subject’s number of times till we get it clearly. I am really happy for having joined this course. It is worth joining Jigsaw Academy. In the tenure of this course I have come across amazing people like Sarita Digumarti, Moses Kola, Qurratulayn Yasin, Ramesh Babu and all the other faculties (teaching and non-teaching staff), who helped in problem solving and all the technical difficulties. I am thankful to all for showing great patience and support towards students like me whenever needed.\n",
      "Jigsaw academy course is really one of the best course for career growth who aspiring and already working in analytic industry. It has good approach which focuses on very much real time aspects and industry exposure by providing case studies and assignments to students. The class recording and video sessions gives students flexibility of individual lessons whenever and repeated number of times they want. Recording and video sessions are valuable essence of this course. The courses cover topics like Regression analytics, data exploration and preparation, Decision Trees from the perspective of Business Understanding etc, which requires in real time scenarios. These studies helps students grow in their analytic career.\n",
      "\n",
      "368) All i can say about Jigsaw Academy is if you wish to learn then they are ready to provide you with anything to make you intellectual and happy.The customer service is better than any other analytic institution in business right now which encouraged me to initially get into the academy. The coursework offered allows me to learn at my own pace while i'm working too.Although i studied in one of the best institutions in my place and is highly ranked in my state Tamil Nadu i didn't get the kind of quality education which these people provide here.The coursework is very interesting and we are only taught to deal with real word problems with convoluted assignments to solve.Right now i'm done with half of my coursework and i was really surprised to get a call from my mentor who was very much unhappy as i didn't call or mail him to get any kind of help.I'm sure you will get your money's worth as well as gain some very good analytically skills once your done with your coursework.As a add on i heard the institution is also working with the placement of students.Hope you all have a great time getting into Jigsaw Academy and gaining knowledge.Happy Learning!! And for me i'm planning to take all the courses as they are very interesting :) cheers bubyeee :D\n",

      "370) Jigsaw Academy is the best academy for Analytics learning. Period.\n",
      "Be it faculty knowledge, course material, business cases covered in class or practical implications of modelling techniques, they leave no stone un-turned. There are a wide range of courses to choose from depending on your experience and area of interest. They provide really good support regarding doubts, assignments, technical issues etc. The methodology of teaching SAS is easy to comprehend and people with any background can learn here. The focus is mainly on business applications rather than deep level coding, which is mostly required in industries. In the foundation course they cover SAS techniques as well as modelling techniques in detail which is enough to kick start your career in Business Analytics. Also they give good placement assistance(via LMS) for people seeking for opportunities.I recommend this to anyone looking for a career in the world of analytics.\n",

      "371) Econometrics and Statistical Analysis have always been my passion since high school. It has been a dream of mine to pursue a career in the field of Business Analytics, characterized by the extensive application of Econometrics, Statistical concepts and Predictive Modeling techniques, every day, on the job. It is thanks to Jigsaw Academy that this dream is finally going to come true!\n",
      "Even though I have a Master's degree in Economics from the University of Auckland, I found that I unfortunately, did not have the required skills to enter the Analytics Industry, as a Fresher. After an extensive search for suitable Analytical training institutes, I came across Jigsaw Academy and I honestly, thank my lucky stars that I did! Not only was the course content very exciting but the fees were very reasonable! Believe me, I came across so many fly-by-night institutes, who were only interested in money and not the welfare of the student!\n",
      "Learning Analytics with Jigsaw Academy has been nothing short of an exciting journey! It was a fun process, where I could learn with confidence, knowing that my lectures were being handled by experts from the industry, with years of experience behind them! I would like to especially mention Saritha here. One of the best teachers, I've ever had, in my life! I always looked forward to her lectures on what were seemingly complicated (but incredibly exciting!) SAS topics such as SAS Functions and Procedures, SAS Combining and Merging, etc. Also, it was fantastic to work with data sets from real life case studies (I am especially fond of the Horse Racing Case Study!) where you get the opportunity to think on your feet and begin acting like a real Analyst! Handling such data sets also gives me immense confidence to handle complicated interviews! With Jigsaw, you can expect nothing but the best!\n",
      "Also, as a student, technical support is incredibly important, especially if the entire learning process takes place online, with assignments to be submitted on the Remote Desktop. All I can say is, throughout my time at Jigsaw, I have had absolutely nothing to worry about! The technical team at Jigsaw have been extremely supportive in understanding my needs and anxieties as a student and are just a phone call or an email away! :) Many thanks Mr. Moses, Mr. Ramesh and the rest of your awesome team for making my learning experience a stress free one! :)\n",
      "Jigsaw Academy also has a great placement assistance team, which takes the time and trouble to review your CV and makes very useful suggestions for improvement and also takes trouble to share a question bank consisting of important questions which could be asked at an interview!\n",
      "Face it, Jigsaw Academy is one of those institutes, which not only imparts valuable knowledge to students, but is also involved in the all round preparation for crucial next steps, such as job interviews, etc. A special thanks to Ms. Roopashri, for all her help and advice! :)\n",
      "My advice to anyone who wishes to pursue a career in Analytics, but requires certain critical skills to make that dream come true, is to look no further. Let Jigsaw Academy be the institute to help you out in pursuit of your dreams! :)\n",
      "\n",
      "372) Jigsaw actually prepares for real world business cases with case studies\n",
      "\n",
      "373) Jigsaw Academy is a great place to Learn Analytics. I previously have ha no experience in Analytics and as a field it really interested me. I did a lot of research and finally zeroed in on 2 institutes in Bangalore for a course on Analytics( My main interest was SAS). After speaking to a few people, I realized Jigsaw was the place to be. Even on doing a good amount of comparisons online(One comparison was between Jigsaw and IIM-B) , I decided that Jigsaw was the institute to enroll for. Though the other option was much more cheaper, at the end of the day, you always select the place from where you could be better off in the future than sooner!\n",
      "The faculty quality is nothing short of exceptional! Fabulous, Experienced, practical as well as a very good hands-on approach to each topic. Especially, considering that SAS is a programming language, a hands-on approach is almost inevitable and this is what makes Jigsaw stand out! Sarita: probably the Best Analytics Prof! You could teach a nation Analytics!! Shilpa Jat: Thank you for constatntly replying to my incessant number of doubts in the assignments!! You have constantly supported and helped me with my issues and topics! Thank you very much!!\n",
      "The support is another brilliant team. Every time I've had issues, they have responded positively as well as promptly! To cite an instance , I was facing an issue while connecting to a Remote Desktop. It was a lazy Sunday Afternoon and I sent a mail to the Support. I immediately(< 5 mins) received a reply which sent me a step-by-step procedure to sort out the issue and I was back to my assignments! Thank you Moses, Ramesh and the Team!!\n",

The content of the videos is short crisp and clear with great examples. Easy to understand and more over their app is most useful. The biggest issue of online learning is about finishing the course. That is why the mobile app which jigsaw has launched for the students now helps u to finish the course more effectively. Now u can do your learning while u travel or whenever u have a few minutes to spare. This way it is easy to finish the course faster and better.\n",

      "R course is much better .when compared to SAS .\n",
      "They rush through the various topics .few short videos on each topic.\n",
      "faculty is busy most of the days on corporate training if you call them . If you go for chat support even that goes to offline message . you need to raise a ticket for every damn issue .it gets sorted within 3 days max.\n",
      "most of things you need to figure out on your own , if you are not that good in self study .dont go for an online course like this one . you will regret mostly .This is not for average students at all .\n",
      "they help you out 20% ,remaining 80% its your own effort .You need to really work your ass off to complete the course .Faculty is helpful but they seem unavailable mostly and it becomes really difficult to get your queries solved through email or phone .You mostly end up browsing through stackoverflow for help .\n",
      "Placement is not good at all .Most of the job which they post are for experienced eg:- 2–3 years of experience working in R and SAS , you ll end up wondering then why would you take up a course online for this , when you already working on it . getting placed is a pure luck . If you know multiple languages in data analytics and you are good at building models . Yes you can sure get a job .its all about working hard and not just joining the courses offered by them .Placement offered by them is mostly in bangalore . If you are ready to relocate , go for it .\n",
      "THERE ARE LOADS OF FREE COURSES AND EVEN PAID COURSES WHICH ARE WAY BETTER THAN JIGSAW .\n",
      "Analytics teaches you the strategy to market your business to attract buyers .Jigsaw is an awesome example for it . it has flashy marketing and 5 star reviews everywhere . the Company has put loads of effort in doing this(they contact the people who write bad reviews and make them remove it somehow) , i wish they would atleast put a bit of this effort in the course content and placement .\n",
      "Its all upto you , how much effort you put in learning from various sources , books , youtube videos , practice practice . Jigsaw gives a certificate and few concepts .thats it .\n",

      "405) Completed Big data specialization course from Jigsaw. Course is well structured and easy to understand. Hands on experience via Lab and case studies make it lot more interesting to learn and grasp the content. Faculty support is good. Apart from the course, Jigsaw hosts lot of competitions where students can connect with industry experts and learn by working on projects in the competition. Really appreciate Jigsaw academy's efforts to conduct such events and engage students. Jigsaw is like a family. They have helped me build my profile in all possible ways and were always there when i needed them. I would recommend students and working professionals who want to get into big data analytics to join the Jigsaw community. As far as finding a job is concerned, Jigsaw will keep posting if there are any opportunities. Students need to spend some time building their profile and keep applying according to their skillset. Usually companies give 30% hike on your current CTC. But it may be more depending on the requirement, role and skillset for which company is hireing.\n",

      "406) First of all I would like to thankful to Team JIGSAW! Recently,I got placed in GSAPNN TECHNOLOGIES, INC. as Jr Data Scientist Trainee.\n",
      "Yes, Its worth of investing time and money but if and only if you have to do the course SINCERELY with PASSIONATE ON Data science.\n",
      "They will help a lot if we show an interest toward it and as fresher It’s easy to learn from scratch with the help of their animated Pre-class video lectures. Its very easy to understand.\n",
      "The assignments they created which are close to current scenario real time projects and you will feel while work on these projects like you are doing real time projects in data science industry.\n",
      "The response from support team and faculty is good which will helps to solve doubts in less time. without any doubt they will show all possible ways to get success in the field of analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "407) I enrolled for the Jigsaw Data science certification because I wanted a job in analytics. The course was good, case studies were helpful and their faculty was prompt.\n",
      "But I had a hard time looking for job openings. I was looking for a job in Hyderabad where my parents stay. All their job openings for Bangalore, Delhi and Mumbai. I called many times but they did not give any openings in Hyderabad.\n",
      "Finally, they put me in touch with a start up in Hyderabad. I got a job after clearing the interview.\n",
      "I think Jigsaw Academy is good but they need to provide placement assistance for all cities in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "408) The Jigsaw Academy has come up with a very unique and neat way of presenting the concepts on Big Data(which I have attended-Big Data Specialist course).\n",
      "The course was in depth , detailed and have provided nice videos on concepts like Map reduce, Pig,Hive.\n",
      "Why to choose Jigsaw Academy?\n",
      "Indepth knowledge on all concepts.\n",
      "Good team for asking queries and getting it resolved.\n",
      "Certifications from IBM can be easy when we go through this course.\n",
      "Pain Points\n",
      "Bigger and better real time projects.\n",
      "More companies are in Noida or places (not Bangalore), which should help.\n",
      "I would only like to add that the real time case studies can be made more regular.\n",
      "\n",
      "409) Yes absolutely. I am currently working as Quality Engineer in Pune since 5 years and willing to switch to data analytics field now. So I joined Jigswa in April 2017 for data science specialization and never regret till now. The course content is perfectly designed so that any person understand basic mathematics will be able to understand easily, access to the study material, lab is also so easy. I think if anyone wants to step into Analytics career then Jigsaw is the best platform for them. Their support is so quick and efficient that if you face any problem and you contact them via email, call or chat they make sure that your issue/query will be resolved in a day. They are full of professionalism and care towards their students. They also keep organising webinars from well known personalities in analytics field. And this helps student like to gain confidence in what we are doing. Specially people like who are willing to change their role. This is indeed best training institue in data analytics/data science/machine learning and what not.\n",
      "\n",
      "410) Absolutely worth investing Time & Money. After completing my IT Engineering, I found the best online course of Data Analytics with Jigsaw Academy. Thanks to the friends who told me about it. I subscribed the online courses last year. Unfortunately, couldn’t yet complete the course due to my other works but really happy with the easiest video lectures and easy-to-understand content. Analytics being a new field, they have really worked well to make easy self-learning video tutorials. Hoping to finish it soon and work in the field of Data Analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "411) Jigsaw Academy would be highly recommended if you are willing to upskill on any of the latest technologies in the market. Their course structure is detailed and the faculties are very helpful.\n",
      "I have had a great experience while doing a course at Jigsaw Academy. Initially i was a little skeptical about doing a online course and did a lot of research on various institutes, I neither had the time nor the bandwidth to take up sometime full time so I finalized on Jigsaw Academy after reading all the good reviews online and on Quora. But once i finished the course i was quite happy with the kind of knowledge i gained during the tenure of the course.\n",
      "I personally believe that getting a job is all about having right skills and knowledge and Jigsaw does a decent job in empowering you with the best of knowledge. With the advent of so many new technologies it has become very vital to up skill for not only sustaining an IT job but upskilling at the same time.\n",
      "You should definitely give it a shot and I would personally recommend their Machine Learning course as i did the same a while ago.\n",
      "All the best & Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "412) I enrolled in Jigsaw Academy for Data Scientist Course. It is a best online delivery center for Analytics.\n",
      "They have best trainers and content for the course they are offering. Mainly on statistics even if we are not from the statistics background, the way they are explaining is easy to understand the logic behind that.\n",
      "Faculty support is pretty good.\n",
      "\n",
      "413) I have done 2 courses with Jigsaw Academy. I did the Foundation course in analytics in April 2013 and I recently completed the data science certification as well. I think if I share my experience it will help.\n",
      "I got interested in analytics when my batch mate got a 6.5 lakh salary as a business analyst. I was making about 4 lakhs pa at that time and the idea of getting 15-20k more in hand was very appealing. I decided to learn business analytics and like most of my ideas it started with a Google search.\n",
      "Eventually I landed on the Jigsaw blog and found very good information there. I think their blog is the best source of information on analytics. Personally, the decision to take their course was very influenced by the quality of the articles on their blog. I also like the videos on their youtube channel.\n",
      "My initial experience with Jigsaw was not very good. My credit card payment was not going through and their team was not of much help. Finally, it got sorted and I started the course.\n",
      "The best thing about the foundation course is that they try to keep it simple as much as they can. Of course, I still found SAS very intimidating when I started. But the support from the faculty was good.\n",
      "I remember the sound quality of some the videos was an issue – the voice was not clear and sometimes their was an echo. I found the audio quality of the newer videos (data science course) a lot better. I have been told they have changed the audio quality of the foundation videos now as well.\n",
      "I think the case studies at Jigsaw are very good. Some of my friends who have done courses in other places tell me the case studies there are more like discussions on a business problem. Whereas, the Jigsaw case studies require you to actually build predictive models on data. This is what helps a Jigsaw student –the case studies I did during my course are very similar to the kind of projects I do now at work.\n",
      "Lately they have also started chat support for the students. This was not there during my first course and I think this is a huge help for students especially on weekends. Getting answers to your questions in real time really helps.\n",
      "I have also seen a lot of Jigsaw copy-cats in the market now. They are trying to offer the same courses as Jigsaw, copying their platform, the virtual lab and everything else. I think imitation is the highest form of flattery and this proves to me that Jigsaw is doing a great job in teaching analytics.\n",
      "Some other things to consider – they are the first ones to tie up with an academic institute of repute (Great Lakes management college) to offer a 1 year program in analytics. I heard their programs are now being offered in IIMs as well.\n",
      "My friends in Accenture tell me Jigsaw does training for Accenture employees as well.\n",
      "I think all of this points to a solid product and customer service. Personally, Jigsaw has helped me shape my career and I will forever be indebted to them for that.\n",
      "\n",
      "414) As I am a beginner in analytics, Jigsaw provided me a good foundation in analytics. I have completed Data Science with SAS (self paced ) on last month.\n",
      "The Course content is effective and it mainly cover SAS section and statistics section. We get to work on real time case studies which helps to get a clear insight about the topic.The LMS system where we can find the Pre class videos, class recordings of each class and course material are enough to explain the concept better. Also we can access Jigsaw Lab (Remote Desktop computer) helps to exercise our case study assignments and SAS codes as well .\n",
      "The faculty and support team are very approachable and really helpful in our queries. They are ready to give individual attention and followup of our issues , a special thanks to Mr.Moses.\n",
      "Overall I had a good learning experience with Jigsaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "415) It all started when someone from Jigsaw called me up and pitched their course. I visited their website previously. I was contemplating on joining some good course to get myself acquainted with Data Analytics. I would have even went ahead to join their course, but their pitch seemed very aggressive. They claim to be the No.1 in India.\n",
      "I was genuinely interested in the beginning but when I started asking more questions, I only got disappointing answers. All I was getting was generic answers. When I prodded more, she couldn't handle and transferred my call to some manager. He was of no help too. They claim to provide 100 percent placement assistance, so I was keen on knowing some stats. They said they currently had more than 5k enrolled students. All I asked was for some rough estimate of how many students got placed through their placement assistance. But I was asked to read testimonials on website and read reviews available online. They said they will get back to me on the next day.\n",
      "I got a call the next day and this time, the manager transferred my call to some other higher official, Balaji, if I remember correctly. I made it clear that I had no doubts regarding their course but I stuck to my request that when they are claiming about the placement assistance, I want some data to support their claim. The same generic answers followed. They say, we have tie ups with 150+ companies. They are the No.1 in the country. They can provide me the best Analytics Course in the market but the placements depend on my learning capability. His response was a bit rude and he even accused me that I was trying to prove their agents wrong. Why on Earth would I care to prove their agent wrong. All I was asking was for some real stats, how many students are enrolled, how many were provided placement assistance, how many successfully got jobs, how many were able to make a career transition? I just asked for some real data. I did not ask for a 100% placement assurance. They did not give me a satisfying response.\n",
      "I’m not going ahead with their course. They have been in this field for quite some time and I do not doubt their credentials. If learning is what you seek, I believe there are better options available at a much affordable cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "416) Yes.\n",
      "You get a deep insight into data analytics as you finish your course in jigsaw academy. You get to work on many case studies as well. There is a placement team, with whom if you register/keep in contact, keep sending you job postings that are around on the internet. Even Otherwise, once you register, there will be a tab for placements/job postings on your profile. They update everything there.\n",
      "I also recommend trying out other websites around… The teaching methods differ and you can find the one that satisfies and suits you the most.\n",
      "Happy Learning!\n",
      "\n",
      "417) When I decided to do a course in analytics, I looked up quite a few instistutes before signing up for the data science course in sas from jigsaw and I am very glad about this because 9 months down the line, I have completed the course, attended interviews that jigsaw facilitated for me and I have a job now in a leading MNC. My experience at jigsaw has been really satisfying. The course content is designed to help even a beginner in this field. The faculty is very approachable and helpful. Yes, after completing the course, I also waited for a bit before I could get an opportunity to attend interviews, but I was in constant touch with the placement team who in turn was supportive in seeing me getting through an opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "418) Really its very useful.\n",
      "In my opinion I learnt lot about analytics from Jigsaw academy.\n",
      "Recently I attended two webinars conducted by jigsaw Academy. Its very effective. NOw I got clear information about, how to get jobs in analytics field without having experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "419) I am a currently a jigsaw student. I enrolled for data science course. It's been few months now and the course is very good. The classes are well structured and easy to understand. It's very easy to interact with faculty regarding queries. Recently I attended webinar how to make up for lack of analytics experience conducted by Snehamoy Mukherjee. The session was really good and I learned a lot. This webinar helps people with lack experience in analytics field gain confidence. Hope jigsaw will conduct more webinars helping students gain knowledge.\n",
      "Subrahmanya Sai Kumar Korapati.\n",
      "\n",
      "420) I attended the BigData Specialist course, which I found to be very valuable with good knowledgeable instructors, good quality of video with detailed steps, and related infrastructure provided adequately.\n",
      "While I might not be looking for a change/hike, I feel personally and professionally this course and Jigsaw has helped me expand my knowledge and skills adequately. I enjoyed the course material, which was very well structured and the instructor videos were of good quality, and the instructors oration was very well paced with live examples and system access, that helped adequately visualize the concept and hands-on approach.\n",
      "I would truthfully suggest this course to anyone interested in expanding their skills and knowledge in new technology streams, but caution is that this is an extensive course with lot of development work (coding) that required serious commitment from the students to complete the coursework, and receive a certification.\n",
      "\n",
      "421) Jigsaw Academy provides the knowledge with the lab practice that makes very easy to understand the concepts. Instructors were really experienced and their expertise in Big data course + analytics makes the subject very easy to understand. I recommend Jigsaw Academy who interested in Big data + analytic field.\n",
      "\n",
      "422) Yes, its worth investing in Jigsaw …… I Joined jigsaw on 30th June 2013 for a combo course.\n",
      "Before joining jigsaw I was almost in double mind whether I will get the satisfactory knowledge which i m expecting and for which i am paying a big amount.\n",
      "But after 2 years I can say definitely that they are doing great work in the field of analytic by grooming the new bees and transferring the knowledge effectively.\n",
      "Jigsaw facility and Support team is one of the best team which I have come across.\n",
      "They were always present 24x7 to support and resolve the issue which the student face during the course.\n",
      "The knowledge transfer which faculty has done is up to the mark. If the student follows each and every step which they have taught during the lecture, they will surely achieve what they want to.\n",
      "\n",
      "423) It is great to see interest about Jigsaw Academy on the Quora forum. As someone who is part of the Academy, obviously my views will be biased and therefore I don’t want to get into answering the questions directly. I do, however, want to give a few pointers on how to evaluate the effectiveness of the course.\n",
      "In my opinion, the experience of the past students is the most effective way to evaluate a course or a training academy. At Jigsaw Academy, we have tons of feedback from our students that we can share with those who are interested. But yes it is easy to question the authenticity of the feedback. Or the authenticity of any other information that comes from the institute itself. There are, however, other ways of getting such information independently.\n",
      "Here are 2 ways you can learn from the ex-students.\n",
      "Social media chatter - You should also find out what people are saying about them on social media. Linked in recommendations should get a fair bit of weight age because its hard to get fake testimonials on LI since they are linked to a person’s profile.\n",
      "Speak to ex-students - Take this a step further, and independently contact some of the people who have given the testimonials. This will give you a good idea about how much weightage to give to the testimonials. Also, you can call up the institute and ask for references of ex-students. Talk to the ex-students directly. Importantly, talk to ex-students who have not given any recommendation anywhere.\n",
      "I think it is important for anyone who is spending their valuable time, effort and money in taking up a course to do proper research to identify the best option for their needs. I hope this post gives you a sense of how to leverage the experience of past students of an institute to make the right decision for yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "424) My experience at Jigsaw Academy has truly been a remarkable one so far.\n",
      "Jigsaw has provided a very professional approach to training especially the course content is designed with pre class videos, pre class reading materials, class session recording, quality assignments, quiz,case studies, competitions etc.\n",
      "Trainers and support are very friendly, lively and approachable. The forum within LMS is interesting, practical and entertaining.\n",
      "I would truthfully suggest Jigsaw to anyone interested in expanding their skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "425) My journey with Jigsaw have been thoroughly engaging, fascinating and satisfying. I have taken almost all courses offered by Jigsaw. All the course contents have been well researched and of high quality. I found the case studies to be especially thought provoking leading to hands-on learning. The courses are right on target in teaching us how to think like a statistician in handling various types of data.\n",
      "The courses aptly cover the best industry practices to tackle various analytical problems. The assignments, quizzes and tests all aid in the learning. I feel I have attained comprehensive knowledge and experience to give me a jump start in my career as a future data scientist.\n",
      "\n",
      "426) I have enrolled for 4 courses in Jigsaw Academy. The course content is designed in such a way to give the overall understanding of topic. With many real time examples in videos and hands on individual lab session makes it a great deal to learn analytics from Jigsaw Academy.\n",
      "The course content is provided with pre-class videos and pre-class materials which covers almost all the basic things needed for that particular class (Both Web based & Instructor led classes).\n",
      "The faculty for the courses are knowledgeable and the interaction with faculty & support team is seamless in getting the issue resolved (whether it is related to subject/topic or general support). It just doesn’t stop with videos and materials. The Case Study will make us utilize all the knowledge gained and understanding the topics learnt. The case studies are designed in such a way to give the real-time experience in Analytics. The Forum or Discussion board makes the students to interact among themselves.\n",
      "I would say that anyone who can sufficiently devote 2-3 hours per day or a minimum of 10 hrs per week can complete the course on time balancing the professional and personal duties.\n",
      "\n",
      "427) Yes definitely. I am a student at present, and can say it has been a very satisfying experience so far. Much beyond what I had initially expected.\n",
      "What I like best is the course design. The focus is 100% on practical application - clearing the interview, securing the job, and actually solving the client problem once in the hot seat. Not obscure theory, formulas, etc. The instructors and course material stress this all the time, which is great.\n",
      "Personally I am very happy with the pace of the class, but some students do find a few classes too fast. In almost all cases its because they have not gone through the pre-class videos. This is something instructors stress on all the time.\n",
      "Instructors really know their stuff. Students are constantly asking them 'what if' kind of questions, and you can tell the faculty are speaking from experience on what works and does not. You can reach out to faculty anytime... very useful when you are just not getting some concept, or working on a tough assignment.\n",
      "There is also a forum where students post questions and get response from other students and faculty. This forum is very useful. You can be part of various study groups, usually from classmates in the same batch.\n",
      "Equally impressive is their support team headed by Qurrat. I have had minor signon issues etc, but all were very speedily resolved. They actually monitor the forum for assignment related questions etc posed by students which I quite like. And they respond promptly. I also like the realtime chat support.\n",
      "My few suggestions to any incoming student : 1) Take advantage of their promotional pricing deals, its really worth it 2) Make sure you have at least 10-15 hours to go through the pre-class videos before every class, or you will be lost 3) Reach out to faculty and other students actively, it will save you a lot of time and guesswork when doing assignments.\n",
      "All in all, a great experience. Highly recommended.\n",
      "\n",
      "428) Jigsaw Academy is one of the best online analytics institute and also tied-up with india best institute like IIM,Great-lakes inst of mangement,some international school.They offer various platfrom of analytics like SAS,R and Hadoop(for Big Data analytics).\n",
      "I was enrolled couple of courses and completed Data science with R course,its good option to put your money and time for your analytics journey.Now days analytics and Bigdata analytics is best career option and if you want shift into this field and eager to learn baseline and advanced concept and technique than Jigsaw is the best option to go with.\n",
      "Because the teaching metheodology ,hands on exercise and real case study are pretty awesome.\n",
      "The LMS system where you can find all the course material,pre classes video and class recording and its very smooth access.\n",
      "The RDC(Remote Desktop Computer) system where you can exercise your assignmets,case study on SAS ,R programming tools.Furthermore if you stuck somewhere in technical problem or in assignment problem,just mail or a phone call to support team,they instantly support you and they are very fast.\n",
      "Finally you have to put at least 10 to 15 hours for the course work then go with Jigsaw because the course content and assignment are so much deep in concepts and once you do that and puts extra hard work ,you can even participate in Kaggle(The world largest Data science competation).Also Jigsaw helps to find the right opportunity in career of analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "429) Yes, If you have background in analytics. No if you are in other background and trying to get into analytics with their certification and assistance which is almost zero. As i tried to do the same and felt like disposing my money in junk so its better to think 100 times before joining the courses.\n",
      "\n",
      "430) I enrolled in Jigsaw Academy and i did a lot of research before doing so. And i guarantee that its the best Private Analytic Institute out there.\n",
      "They have the best trainers available, specially sarita who has managed things very efficiently and not to mention the statistics part , which she teaches like a piece of cake.\n",
      "The video based course allows you to change the pace of the class which helped me to complete the Foundation Course with SAS in just 12 days (7-9 hours daily) and it was worth every second and every penny.\n",
      "They also have an Arsenal of Real Time case studies which help you to practice and get in depth knowledge of data/domain which is available in their online lab (accessible 24*7 ).\n",
      "P.S - If you are ready to spend quality time for analytics then this course with Jigsaw will be your best choice , but if you are too lazy to work ( which is not too much as jigsaw even provides what to do next when you are stuck somewhere and even has a discussion section for contacting peers) then you better not join any analytic course and sit on your couch sipping coke and watching Game Of Thrones (i am a fan by d way :) )\n",
      "\n",
      "431) I am doing Big Data Scientist Specialization - R /Hadoop/Tablue. Chose Jigsaw as they are very good on Online delivery of Education. Being it content, pace of study, online support, remote desktop connections too practice, support through mail, phone, chat system. One can test your understanding of each topic through the quizzes and assignments for each topic. Infact recording is provided for each class has good quality. Thanks Jigsaw for helping me in my quest. Overall I can say best place to join, if wish to really learn. At Jigsaw content is designed to cover almost every detail on topic, so it saves time to search further on topic, and thus saves money.\n",
      "\n",
      "432) It is a very compact course and good to learn analytics from the scratch.For me yes it is worth investing time and money. I was totally new to analytics and it really helped me a lot to change or restart my career. In 69000/- I got the Big Data Unicorn which includes- SAS,R,PYTHON,EXCEL,BIG DATA ANALYTICS,APACHE SPARK, APACHE STORM,CASSANDRA,MONGODB which I think quite affordable. The case studies and assignments are really helpful to gain knowledge.I finished the data science course in 8 months. And just after finishing it,I got an Internship opportunity from Jigsaw in a Marketing Analytics Company in Bangalore with some kind of job assurance as per my performance in the internship period. Some feedback I would like to share that- the python course can be bit more informative. There should be a capstone project in python. Implementation of decision tree in SAS would be a good option and also some algorithms like KNN,random forest,bagging,boosting,stacking,K fold cross validation can be included in R. Faculties are good. Promptness in response to the tickets from the faculties, is average. Placement support is very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "433) I enrolled with Jigsaw Academy for Data Science with SAS and Data Science with R. The course content is not only effective, but its also very practical. The faculty and support staff are very friendly and ever helpful. The best part is that the assignments actually require you to apply all the concepts taught in the class. All in all Jigsaw gives you a full-fledged learning experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "434) Yes... Its worth investing in this course, as it would definitely add to the career and new avenues to grow towards analytics. For beginners its a good platform to start with if they are interested in Market analytics, business analytics.\n",
      "Investing time. Yes its worth as they give the best information and training for your time invested. core statistical knowledge is refilled here for marketeres.\n",
      "I would definitely recommend to keep Jigsaw as the first choice to learn analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "435) I had enrolled for the DATA SCIENCE for SAS course with Jigsaw.I must admit ,that the course is well designed.Blend of pre-class videos on different sections and live instructor led classes certainly helped me comprehend programming concepts and analytical techniques available across excel and SAS.The LMS is also seamless.\n",
      "Kudos to the faculty and support team as well.They have always been prompt with clarifying doubts.\n",
      "\n",
      "436) I completed foundation in analytics and data scientist courses at jigsaw during the last year. Quality student care and investment worthy course contents are some of the highlights of jigsaw academy. Getting my first job was a calkwalk with the help of Jigsaw placements. In the interviews i have attended so far, Jigsaw academy certification is been considered by all of them. It is no wonder i still turn up to the experts in jigsaw for suggestions. With salary packages doubling every year for a data science professional, i would definitely say it is a good investment for the future.\n",

      "439) Jigsaw Academy is a great place to Learn Analytics. I previously have ha no experience in Analytics and as a field it really interested me. I did a lot of research and finally zeroed in on 2 institutes in Bangalore for a course on Analytics( My main interest was SAS). After speaking to a few people, I realized Jigsaw was the place to be. Even on doing a good amount of comparisons online(One comparison was between Jigsaw and IIM-B) , I decided that Jigsaw was the institute to enroll for. Though the other option was much more cheaper, at the end of the day, you always select the place from where you could be better off in the future than sooner!\n",
      "The faculty quality is nothing short of exceptional! Fabulous, Experienced, practical as well as a very good hands-on approach to each topic. Especially, considering that SAS is a programming language, a hands-on approach is almost inevitable and this is what makes Jigsaw stand out! Sarita: probably the Best Analytics Prof! You could teach a nation Analytics!! Shilpa Jat: Thank you for constatntly replying to my incessant number of doubts in the assignments!! You have constantly supported and helped me with my issues and topics! Thank you very much!!\n",
      "The support is another brilliant team. Every time I've had issues, they have responded positively as well as promptly! To cite an instance , I was facing an issue while connecting to a Remote Desktop. It was a lazy Sunday Afternoon and I sent a mail to the Support. I immediately(< 5 mins) received a reply which sent me a step-by-step procedure to sort out the issue and I was back to my assignments! Thank you Moses, Ramesh and the Team!!\n",
      "Overall a great institute! A great future to a great start-up!!\n",
      "\n",
      "440) Jigsaw academy course is really one of the best course for career growth who aspiring and already working in analytic industry. It has good approach which focuses on very much real time aspects and industry exposure by providing case studies and assignments to students. The class recording and video sessions gives students flexibility of individual lessons whenever and repeated number of times they want. Recording and video sessions are valuable essence of this course.\n",
      "Jigsaw academy provides wonderful faculties and staff who really help students in their queries. They are very supportive and helpful. Jigsaw academy concentrates on each of their student’s growth in academy. It is worth investing time and money on this course. This course covers topics like Regression analytics, data exploration and preparation, Decision Trees from the perspective of Business Understanding etc, which requires in real time scenarios. These studies helps students grow in their analytic career.\n",
      "\n",
      "441) I had to enrolled for the online analytics course with certain apprehension about the approach but right from the start my worries were laid to rest. I enrolled for the video based classes of the foundation course. I opted for this primarily because of ease of access to the class recordings given I had to deal with my 2 year old toddler. The content was crisp,to the point and simple.Concepts were explained in very simple terms and the faculty chat option to resolve any queries was also great.The assignments ensured I got a feel of how real time problems can be approached through analytics.\n",
      "This course has helped me regain my confidence in venturing smoothly into new areas if my interest given I come from banking background with core expertise in marketing.\n",
      "Thank you jigsaw for opening the world of analytics for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "442) I had completed the Analytics with Excel and Visual Basic for Analytics programs through jigsaw it was great experience for me to learn at my own pace. currently planing to take a IoT course and along with Machine learning and AI.\n",
      "Course contents are good and easy to understand and learn. The case studies helped me to understand how to solve the problems. In terms of the faculty support it was really up to the mark. Whenever i raised any concerns it was resolved within the stipulated time. Such vivid experiences made my choice to do analytic with Jigsaw really awesome.\n",
      "The class videos are easy to understand and explains in a simple way and it's really helpful for my carrier switch-over.\n",
      "They are offering courses with affordable price compare to other online provider & course content and lab facility will be the cheaper price and good time utilization for improving our knowledge.\n",
      "Overall, this has been a great experience and would recommend to my friends who are busy to go to classroom training. Great training experience!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "443) I was planning to enrol for the Jigsaw Course on Big Data & Hadoop but initially enrolled for their short course with Jigsaw Academy on Fraud Analytics using Logistic Regression. This was to test how good is this institute and whether my investment (Rs 42k) going to be worth. Personally, I have over 10 years experience in Analytics and have used Logistic Regression several times so it was good to test them.\n",
      "I found the course below average. The good parts are the SAS code, word document and their over enthusiastic pre-sales team. The good things ended pretty quickly and I was left with a poor experiencc. The instructor almost rushed through the material and didn't explain the rationale behind the steps, which was a major disappointment. Several key points prior to carrying out a logistic regression were skipped and several key checks one would carry out post logistic regression were completely missed out. The worst part was I sent over a list of questions on the video and it is 20+ days as I write this and still no response (where is their promise of quick response?).\n",
      "If you are complete beginner in analytics and take this course, you may be impressed but with reasonably good experience in analytics, you will be totally disappointed. I am not sure how other online courses compare but I have seen some good stuff on Coursera/Udemy or even Youtube which are a lot better and free. So please think carefully before investing your money and time in doing courses with such institutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "444) I enrolled in Jigsaw academy for Big Data course in 2016. As a fresher, it was good start for me with theories and hands-on experience in Big data analytics. For me, invested time and money earned me good job.\n",
      "Each topic in course had enough theories and hands-on exercises that i had to do on their distributed learning platform which enriched concepts about big data infrastructures.\n",
      "After completing course, they provided placement assistance with some mock interviews, resume building etc.\n",
      "Overall, its worth investing time and money in Jigsaw academy\n",
      "\n",
      "445) Indeed a great learning experience. The course at Jigsaw academy is well structured and application based. The standard of assignments and case studies are high which will help in getting strong hold of fundamental concepts.Initially I enrolled in \"Data Science with R\" but after seeing the rapid improvement in my learning curve I enrolled into \"Jigsaw Wiley Big Data Specialist\" course as well which is equally good..\n",
      "\n",
      "446) There exist far less costly and more useful courses. Search around. Lets clarify one thing here about the upcoming branding claims; they were the early movers in a fairly new field, they are trying to cash in those [3-4?] years of their presence in the google results! , instead of the product. Compare the content and services being offered and you'd see a far clearer picture and then decide.\n",
      "About time investment, that's your call. You give time to yourself, you give money to them.\n",
      "Break down the question:\n",
      "1.Will the business analytics [and other such courses] would help me learn new things/ my career etc. ?\n",
      "2. Business analytics in itself, being a broad subject, what things do i need to learn and in what order?\n",
      "3. Who all are offering to teach all these things. and then whom should i select.\n",
      "__________________________________________________________\n",
      "This part is to help you differentiate between fake and genuine. and I had to write this because of this \"well researched\" tag mentioned in one of the answers.\n",
      "- Do find out who are the participants and other \"academies\" who received the prestigious \"Analytics Academy\" award. May be i'm the only who finds it fishy.\n",
      "-Analytic india mag, does list many other courses and happens to be a paid blog. You should use that to find what other options you have, all good institutes have themselves listed there. But i would take their \"Opinions\" with a pinch of salt. I find it suspicious that most of the good news about Jigsaw comes from there.\n",
      "-About linkedin reviews, Coursera doesn't even has that section, why? they dont need it. I randomly searched for google and in its product section it was recommended by \"327\" people. Google recommended by just 327 people. Bottom line, no body really cares for a linkedin review , its a marketting gimmick, you have 65 reviews if you push for it. Certainly a good marketing move , if someone falls for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "447) Most people who gave positive feedback for Jigsaw here, interestingly has given only one answer in Quora. Looks like they joined Quora to campaign for Jigsaw only. Highly Suspicious!!\n",
      "\n",
      "448) Before answering these questions, I would first ask you to get a clarity whether you would be able to take online course or not. Because online courses need more dedication and input than offline courses. Good thing about online courses is that you can study according to your convenience but you have to make sure that convenience doesn't get converted to laziness.\n",
      "Now coming to Jigsaw academy, no doubt it is a reputed institution. I enrolled myself in data science course. Being a mechanical engineer, I thought it would be difficult to catch up things. But they start each and every topic with very basic and I didn't find any difficulty in understanding the subject. There will be topic wise assignments that we have to complete to get certification, and that is a good part. There will be case study for each topic that will help you to work on real time problems.\n",
      "I found the course content to be enough to understand the concepts of data science. For depth of knowledge, later you can refer books.\n",
      "From money point of view, I found it little costly but worth.\n",
      "For job, they keep sending mails regarding vacancies. Only problem here is that most of the companies ask for experience in the required domain. And it will be there in any job requirement irrespective of the institution.\n",
      "Hike percentage depends on different factors like your knowledge, your background etc. and not just institution.\n",
      "In a nutshell, you can go for the course but make sure to check the course content before. And remember, any institute can provide you the study material, but how much you learn from it depends only on you.\n",
      "\n",
      "449) Jigsaw’s online courses are really worth the time and investment…..their faculties are always ready to help whenever required. I received internship through jigsaw in one of the prominent digital analytics company in bengaluru. From my personal experience I can say it’s better than many full time data science courses running in market…..would surely suggest it to anyone who wants to start their journey into analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "450) I shall share my experience, if that helps:\n",
      "I am currently doing my IoT full stack course from Jigsaw. I have also completed a couple of other online courses (machine learning, data science, etc.).\n",
      "The key difference is the faculty addressing each issue, discussing with you over a call, as soon as you create a ticket, quick turnaround faculty support. Also, when asked for additional support, apart from the course, they were more than happy to support me, which is according to me a great learning experience.\n",
      "They also give scholarships to deserving candidates, which is also a very attractive feature. I have availed the scholarship.\n",
      "While I was researching on IoT courses, the course content on Jigsaw was much promising for a beginner in IoT. And it has helped me to gain knowledge and build a couple of simple products too.\n",
      "They have now tied up with IBM as well, which means once I complete IBM IoT, I get 2 certificates. I am looking forward to completing that as well. Double gain.\n",
      "I recommend this course to all who are beginners in IoT, who wants to know about Arduino, Node MCU, Raspberry Pi and interactions among these 3, getting it synced with Cloud, etc.\n",
      "It may not be like any other online courses, each online-course-provider is different. But they are always open to suggestions/feedback.\n",
      "Also, there are many interesting features like twice a week they have brain-teasers (if you like puzzles, etc. and if you win it, you get goodies too). Good industry articles every day. Monthly Webinars and open-houses, which I have not seen happening in any other online courses so far.\n",
      "This makes it more interactive, and there is good interaction with students from the industry experts, support team and faculties.\n",
      "I am enjoying my learning and plan to build some IoT products soon.\n",
      "I have not availed any placement services yet and not sure about the hike as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "451) I have learnt R and BigData Analytics in Jigsaw Acedamy. After certification, placement cell assisted me.\n",
      "Jigsaw placement team is doing a fairly good job in terms of polishing our resume as per the market requisite and then getting it forwarded to right place.\n",
      "On regular basis, students keep getting the list of openings in various companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "452) I have enrolled for the Full Stack Data Science course from Jigsaw Academy.\n",
      "The course has weekend online sessions (Saturday and Sunday) and also promised some good reference course material and content to follow for the rest of the week and prepare for the classes the following weekend.\n",
      "To my surprise, the material provided was very minimal and just brushed on the major topics.I still had to search and refer materials online. The quality of teaching was pretty average. Before enrolling, I was told that they have faculty with industry experience of more than 15 years. But, I found some of them were new to data science having less than 5 year experience.\n",
      "Overall I feel I did a mistake by joining this course from Jigsaw academy. There are more good quality courses and institutes out there.\n",
      "\n",
      "453) Personally, I looked at their course and fee structure and I don't think it is justified to take the course.\n",
      "Also, noticed something fishy on the website. Sarita' linkedin profile link does. It googled her name, but couldn't find any strong evidence of her having studied at Tufts U.\n",
      "p.s. Anybody is free to prove me wrong.\n",
      "\n",
      "454) I have 7 years experience in data analysis using SAS and R with no formal education in statistics and data science or predictive modeling. Initially, I struggled a lot when it comes to applying analytics in different domains. However, When I joined as student at Jigsaw Academy,Online School of Analytics, I became better at data analysis. I was able to understand which data mining to use to solve a business problem,how to interpret results, what and how to communicate results of data analysis with others in business language.\n",
      "I feel happy about joining Jigsaw to get trained in analytics by good mentors and faculties. After completing the foundation training at jigsaw, I feel, I made the right decision in my career. I received lot of Interview calls and Job offers from many organization for various analytics position.Thanks to Jigsaw and team for making analytics training available at a very nominal fee compared to other analytics training program in the world.\n",
      "It has been more than 3.5 years, my quest for data analytics field is increasing day by day. The benefits and ROI I am reaping even today, is worth more than the training fee.\n",
      "Moreover, I made many like-minded friends here, who are always there to support and guide me in my Analytics career.\n",
      "And I suggest other students before joining any training program to evaluate what are we really getting in terms of learning and networking opportunities and what are the losses in not joining the Jigsaw Academy analytics ecosystem. Not to forget the benefits of Online classes, which save your travel time and other time and gives you increased time span at home for practicing data analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "455) I had a very good learning experience with Jigsaw Academy so far. I have been enrolled for Data Science with SAS. The course content was amazing and trainer focused on practical approach and discussed industry related problems and solutions. Their real time scenarios have added a great value to my knowledge and work.\n",
      "The best part of Jigsaw is it’s staff are very supportive, specially Mr. Moses, who is very kind, approachable anytime, helps people from the starting of course to till the end, I will rate Jigsaw Academy as the best in the Industry and I have referred lot of my friends and colleagues to Jigsaw Academy. It’s an value for your money.\n",
      "Hope this helps….\n",
      "\n",
      "456) It was a good decision for me to invest money in Jigsaw’s course. I had taken a sabbatical for 8 years & is now a data scientist because I took up this course & let them groom me with their industry experience & knowledge. If you have decided to be a data scientist then Jigsaw can actually groom you into one.\n",
      "\n",
      "457) I would certainly recommend Jigsaw Academy. I have completed Data Science with R & SAS in 2015 and 2016 respectively and presently I am doing Big Data Certification. I am very much happy that I learned a lot from them. The course contents are right from the basics of Analytics to Programming Part. My experience with the academy until now has been remarkable. The course contents and assignments are very appropriate. Trainers/Customer Support for various issues like Conceptual Doubts/Assignments/LMS...etc will been resolved ASAP.\n",
      "\n",
      "458) Right now I am pursuing a data science course from Jigsaw academy. I have gone through content of course and I have also enrolled for other data science online courses but lessons tought in jigsaw course are far better than others and specially for one important reason is that the ease with which they present the information and how to implement the same practically.\n",
      "The assignment they provide are really great for practice.\n",
      "But the most important thing that I learnred in last 4 months of my course after going through lectures and attending webinars is that if you want to get placed in a company instead of learning all the tools you should focus on techniques to implement.\n",
      "If you are good in one tool than practice each in every technique in that.\n",
      "All the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "459) My answer will be YES.\n",
      "I am currently doing Data Science course here.\n",
      "I have done my research on all the Course providers before joining here. I have to admit these guys are providing budget friendly courses and Virtual Labs so no need to have high RAM Computers and Install costly software. I am having 18 months access to all the labs in my Course.All we need to have is a net connection and even a notepad will do the job. This is a more reasonable option while choosing a course.\n",
      "\n",
      "460) Jigsaw Academy is the pioneer in the Data Scientist courses in India. Realizing the potential of data analytics and the important role it is going to play in the coming years, I enrolled myself in PGPDM at Jigsaw Academy in the year 2015. What I observed here is that participants are equipped with skill sets relevant to the job market and as such placement opportunities are good.\n",
      "However, you need to honestly assess your career goals, interests and aptitude before enrolling in any particular course. You can take up these courses if you are interested in switching tracks or honing your skills further for better and more challenging job opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "461) Jigsaw academy is very good. In showing the content and explaining the course. Faculty is too good in explaining the contents and doubts.\n",
      "\n",
      "462) Jigsaw Academy is a leading online analytics and big data courses provider. After getting feedbacks from the students and researching over the internet, it would be right to say that these courses can accelerate your career in the right direction. Interactive teaching assisted by webinars, discussions and assignments, problem-solving and in-depth analysis of the subject will offer you a unique learning experience, and develop expertise readily recognized by the job market. You will gain expertise and experience in the field of data analytics. However, you need to show higher level of commitment and dedication to derive the maximum from the experience and knowledge of instructors.\n",
      "With highly promising prospects for a rewarding career and salary hikes, these courses will be worth investing your time and money. It can be analyzed from students’ reviews and placement record that the academy also provides excellent placement opportunities with the top recruiters like Genpact, IBM, Accenture, Wipro, etc. Professionals after completing a course in data science and analytics easily get salary between INR 6 lakhs to 12 lakhs in India and $65,000 to $130,000 globally at entry level.\n",
      "\n",
      "463) Is this a good time to switch career & change profile for a 6 years IT experienced person who has no practical experience in data analytics? I'm asking this coz i found data analytics interesting but I'm skeptical in commencing my career as a fresher with this new job profile\n",
      "\n",
      "464) I took this course as I was a beginner and I found the course to be very informative. It gave me enough lab hours to practice and the class room videos were up to the mark. I was able to accumulate a lot of knowledge about sas. The support team is also very helpful. They are there for you whenever you need them.I am planning to take a big data course as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "465) Very detailed plan for the course. Extremely knowledgable staff.\n",
      "The way each chapter plunges into depth by starting off with a very basic level is appreciated.\n",
      "\n",
      "466) I am a Jigsaw student currently enrolled for IoT course.\n",
      "In short, what one needs is hold on a topic which you get with good knowledge.\n",
      "The course content is very good…needs lot of hardwork and dedication to complete the course.\n",
      "I have no idea about recognition of certificate from Jigsaw. They get recognized only when ppl show good knowledge and get well placed.\n",
      "Apart from this, faculty support is kind of okay…..only compliant is that we need to raise ticket for any issue. Faculty not available on call.\n",
      "The course content access is provided only for 365 days which according to me needs to be reconsidered as there are many academies which offer lifetime access. Since the courses are bit expensive and also course content is huge and complex, lifetime access must be provided.\n",
      "Regarding placements, I too was told some flatterring success stories…was assured of CV update support and job opportunities. The services are there. But what I see is that the jobs posted are for ppl with <2yrs exp and not for high experienced ppl.\n",
      "\n",
      "467) Data science course in Jigsaw academy is good interms of content, live class sessions, general support experience and faculty support.\n",
      "Q&A session is good interms of having regular sessions. Overall experience was better in learning and getting excited to tools.\n",
      "A special thanks to Mr.Moses who have helped in every aspects throughout the course.\n",
      "Looking forward for the placement support.\n",
      "\n",
      "468) I can see lots of people here giving positive feedback here for Jigsaw. But haven't seen anyone who has taken the course and has got the job. Anyone??\n",
      "\n",
      "469) I can say it is absolutely worth investing both time and money for the Jigsaw courses.\n",
      "Various courses provided by Jigsaw are most conversant courses which are required to be into Analytics role. The study approach that Jigsaw follows and the real time cases which are provided to solve really helps students to get the feel of the kind of role they are aspiring for. While being in course, they gets their hands free on various modelling techniques that are used in industries on real time.\n",
      "Also the placement team is doing a fairly good job in terms of polishing your CV as per the market requisite and then getting it forwarded to right place. On regular basis, students keep getting the list of openings in various companies. We should understand that Jigsaw does anything possible for any candidate for getting placed, but getting through depends on various factors like how confident are you on the subject matter; has the hiring company shortlisted your profile; are you at par with what the requirement is; your current pay; any many more. Any institute (as far as I know) provides the assistance in job, but nobody guarantees you in landing into any job. They can only shape you up as per the market, but getting through depends on factors which I mentioned.\n",
      "Hike percentage entirely depends on the level you are into, the designation and band you are going to be, the company standard, confidence on the subject matter and practicability.\n",
      "\n",
      "470) I also find same points mentioned above by this person, I also enrolled to same course and not find it that great. If 80% effort u need to make so better go for udacity, coursera , udemy with international reputation, When going for placement u need to be 3 year experienced in same field, then why one would go for these courses from Jigsaw.\n",
      "No mentoring, no guiding , nothing . I took intructor led course, it was same as video lectures. And I paid 20000 extra for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "471) It's worth it to join jigsaw to develop skills placement and faculty support are good .for fresher it's good to join jigsaw classroom program\n",
      "\n",
      "472) One of the courses offered by Jigsaw Academy is a Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science which is a full-time 11-month course. The course is really good and offers certification from one of the top institutes in Country MAHE(Manipal Academy of Higher Education). The curriculum is also well structured and this course is a good option if you want to upskill or change domain. Here are some more features of the course\n",
      "100% placement assistance and guarantee* (Guaranteed placement* or INR 30,000 p.m. financial support for 3 months)\n",
      "Master Data Visualization, EDA, Artificial Intelligence & Neural Networks\n",
      "Apply the methods, tools & techniques to real-world problems by leveraging multiple technologies\n",
      "Learn emerging data science of unstructured data analysis and robotic process automation & more by industry experts\n",
      "Get Postgraduate Diploma by Manipal Academy of Higher Education, an Institute of Eminence by UGC\n",
      "The PG Diploma in Data Science India includes Immersive classroom sessions, complemented with assignments and case studies during after-class hours\n",
      "Modern classrooms and data science labs equipped with the latest analytics software & applications.\n",
      "Course taught by the best minds in the Analytics domain with 15+ years of experience including industry subject matter experts (SMEs)\n",
      "4 Industry Discussions, 5 Case Studies, 3 Assignments & 3 Industry Projects\n",
      "Domain-Specific electives on Marketing and BFSI Analytics, Unstructured Data Analysis, Robotic Process Automation, and Linear Programming.\n",
      "Overall, in general, the course is one of the best in India but it is a classroom module one and also full time so working professionals might find it hectic and they would have to leave the job to pursue and cope up with this course.\n",
      "Also, it is very expensive @ 5 lac plus, so it is a lot of investment that’s why I would also suggest you check one other platform Learnbay. I did my Data Science certification course from here as its cheaper @ less than 1 lac but the quality of the course curriculum and their trainers were great. Here why Learnbay is recommended…\n",
      "Learnbay’s DataScience & AI Course is designed for Working professionals hence he had a great amount of flexibility on timings of the batch that he can choose according to his availability.\n",
      "Although he was from an engineering background his programming skills were weak but Learnbay’s program is designed in such a way that it starts from the Base/Scratch level and goes to the advanced level, also they provide extra classes to students who are not programmers.\n",
      "Their instructors are not just professors but are experienced professionals in the industry. Their Instructors Are Working in Industry as AI/ML experts and are Graduates/Masters from Premier Institute like IIT/IIM and they were very supportive of any doubts that arose.\n",
      "Their course fee is also relatively cheaper and very affordable @ approx 75k\n",
      "But there is no compromise in the content of the course as the curriculum is well designed, up to date and in relevant with the industry standards and the course is designed in a practical approach manner with case studies, capstone projects and more\n",
      "There are 15+ real-time projects that students can choose to pursue under the guidance of a trainer making him/her industry ready and getting hands-on experience and practical application\n",
      "of knowledge.\n",
      "Also, the program they offered is IBM Certified making it a globally recognized one.\n",
      "They provide job assistance with interview training so as you will be able to crack any Data science interviews with ease.\n",
      "Many of the students have been placed in the top product based MNCs like IBM, TCS, Cognizant, etc\n",
      "So in all the Jigsaw courses are good although expensive, but, if you compare it with Learnbay’s IBM certified one, So, based on the good experience I had with them I would recommend you check out Learnbay.\n",

      "473) I had completed the Full Stack Data Science course from Jigsaw Academy which was really well designed keeping in mind the market requirements for the role of data analysts. The course has given me confidence to apply the positions of data analyst and crack it. I would really like to recommend this course for better market exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "474) Jigsaw academy Course is too older. I enrolled for the Data science boot camp program and I must say it is complete wasted of Rs. 90 k money most importantly time it just give introduction every tool.\n",
      "If your fresher donot go there they will not placement team will not help you and certification has no value in the Data science Industry\n",

      "475) Hi , Am a novice is Data Analytics , I have 7 years of experience in Messaging and Collaboration technologies and now planning to move to Analytics , Could some body suggest which tools i should learn , I was told by Jigsaw team to take up either R and Big data or Saas and R. Also , what would be the salary packages, I currently drew a decent salary .\n",
      "Welcome your advises and Suggestion - Thanks\n",
      "\n",
      "476) Hey!\n",
      "So, I will be coming directly to your query, as you asked about “should invest time, and money”, it is good to know you analyze your things. So, talking about Jigsaw Academy, it is a really good platform to learn.\n",
      "The course content is designed to help even a beginner in this field. The content was crisp, to the point, and simple. Concepts were explained in very simple terms and the faculty chat option to resolve any queries was also great. The assignments ensured I got a feel of how real-time problems can be approached through analytics. The Course content is effective and it mainly covers the SAS section and statistics section. We get to work on real-time case studies which help to get a clear insight into the topic. The LMS system where we can find the Pre-class videos, class recordings of each class, and course material is enough to explain the concept better. Also, we can access Jigsaw Lab (Remote Desktop computer) helps to exercise our case study assignments and SAS codes as well.\n",
      "You get to work on many case studies as well. The faculty and support team are very approachable and helpful in our queries. They are ready to give individual attention and follow-up of our issues.\n",
      "They provide you the following courses:\n",

      "Apart from Jigsaw , there are many other good platforms like Learnbay, Simplilearn , Udemy , Upgrad, Edureka that offers some amazing and interesting courses. Learnbay( recommended) focuses on quality learning by providing industry-based learning which is cost-effective. It has highly qualified professionals striving to help the aspirants in every possible way. They also offer 15+ real-time projects and equally focus on job assistance.\n",

      "477) I understand that this is a very difficult decision to decide as to which course to choose on for data science, machine learning and AI. I am writing this review for many of the aspiring students who ask me this question on linkedin.\n",
      "Hope this helps!\n",
      "As a past student and the research I did before joining this course was about the quality and quantity. Quality in terms of professors and quantity in terms of material and time.\n",
      "Data Science, Machine Learning and AI being a very vast topic, does require a lot of time and learning. I had investigated some of the courses which are no doubt very cheap and the time they give is very short. I can confidently say very short as I have already done this course and have seen my colleagues doing similar kind of course but are lost. It’s so fast for them is that they are not able to understand one topic and a very big topic comes next.\n",
      "The major point that I considered while perusing this course was the topics being covered and the time spent for each of them. Yes, these topics are vast and does require a lot of time and self learning, but that is not the only thing. The major plus point of this course was the people who taught us. Since for most of us this was a new topic and the major dilemma for a student to learn a new topic is the belief on what they are being taught. Why would I believe in someone who is him/herself a rookie in this field, right? As you can check the PGPD UC, jigsaw official page and can check there linkedin page as how much experienced they are what they can offer you as a professor. These professors are a well-known in name in University of Chicago and Jigsaw as well as industry in terms of guest lecturers. Why would I learn from someone who is a newbie this field, but from someone who is a learned professional and is already leading projects in this field. (I have already received some offers to be a part time trainer in some of the institutes )\n",
      "Placements are part of the process for such courses and Jigsaw provides a good support for it. They do provide call from known companies from their corporate tie up and let you attend interview. I do have registered on Naukri and receive dozens of mail every day. To get job in this industry is surely not that easy and requires thorough knowledge in this subject. As from my experience, I can say that people do appreciate the courses you have done but at the end, it all drills down to you. Were you able to answer questions as per there satisfaction? If not then I don’t think any course available will help you out. At most they can help you understand the topic and clear your doubts, which I found very useful in this course.\n",
      "\n",
      "478) If you ask me to describe Jigsaw Academy in one word i would say “Incredible”. This bootcamp is worth every penny you pay. The course is fast paced, but you get to understand each and every concept clearly. The faculty at Jigsaw are really supportive and friendly, they make you feel comfortable and that makes learning process easy. Coming to the content, you have both classroom learning and online videos. The faculties explain the topics thoroughly in classroom and online videos contain clear explanations as well. If you don't understand a concept, you can raise the doubt and they repeat it right away. The structure of the course is step by step and they start from the basics and move up the ladder to advanced ones. One advantage of taking classroom learning is you get to interact with the faculty freely and clear your doubts right away and you get to meet people who are already working. As a fresher, i got to know a few people in which they shared their experience of how working environment is, and their advice will help me with future job opportunities. Coming to the support, they make you feel really comfortable and they resolve your queries quickly. You get frequent emails on job opportunities from the placement team. Like i said above, taking bootcamp course at Jigsaw Academy was an incredible experience and it's worth every penny you pay.\n",
      "Thank you Jigsaw Academy\n",
      "Hope it helps!!\n",
      "\n",
      "479) It depends on your interest in Data analytics. If you are really invested in it, its a good start point. They help learn Machine learning basic concepts in R, such as regression, random forest, Time series forecasting. Python was rushed through. Tableau and SAS are online video walkthroughs. It has been more than 2 months since I’ve completed the course in the given assigned time(about 10% of us managed to complete it in 3 months) i.e. submission of assignments before the deadline, but that didn’t give me any bragging rights when it came to getting placed through Jigsaw(as promised before enrollment). I’m still waiting for an interview through Jigsaw that could help me land one. I will update this thread if I do get placed through Jigsaw academy.\n",
      "\n",
      "480) Yes, there are quite a few good institutes that provide Data Science Training, you have to do quite a good research before you enroll yourself for Data Science Training. You will have to look out for the job role which you are interested in and according to work on that.\n",
      "I will review some institutes that provide Data Science Course:\n",
      "Simplilearn: The program features 68 hours of in-depth learning. This is not a course most people can hit off in a single weekend or even over a single week. The course also includes four real-life, industry-based projects with corresponding demos. You can visit their website\n",
      "for further details.\n",
      "Jigsaw Academy: They do have different courses under this Specialization which longs from 3months to 10 months. you can choose the duration and the course accordingly. To know more visit here.\n",
      "Learnbay: Learnbay is an institute that provides Online as well as Classroom training sessions. The Data Science Master's Program that they provide is a whole package that almost covers everything that is needed. They do have 12+ Real-time projects on different domains. You can visit Data Science Certification Course\n",
      "for further details.\n",

      "481) Well on the counter part i see below grievances for Jigsaw and what matters in the end is what was the resolution and how my issue was dealt with:\n",
      "Pasting few grievances from customers who are unhappy with what Jigsaw is offering:\n",
      "I was planning to enrol for the Jigsaw Course on Big Data & Hadoop but initially enrolled for their short course with Jigsaw Academy on Fraud Analytics using Logistic Regression. This was to test how good is this institute and whether my investment (Rs 42k) going to be worth. Personally, I have over 10 years experience in Analytics and have used Logistic Regression several times so it was good to test them.\n",
      "I found the course below average. The good parts are the SAS code, word document and their over enthusiastic pre-sales team. The good things ended pretty quickly and I was left with a poor experiencc. The instructor almost rushed through the material and didn't explain the rationale behind the steps, which was a major disappointment. Several key points prior to carrying out a logistic regression were skipped and several key checks one would carry out post logistic regression were completely missed out. The worst part was I sent over a list of questions on the video and it is 20+ days as I write this and still no response (where is their promise of quick response?).\n",
      "If you are complete beginner in analytics and take this course, you may be impressed but with reasonably good experience in analytics, you will be totally disappointed. I am not sure how other online courses compare but I have seen some good stuff on Coursera/Udemy or even Youtube which are a lot better and free. So please think carefully before investing your money and time in doing courses with such institutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "482) Jigsaw Academy teaches online courses in Data Science, Big Data, Analytics, Machine Learning. They are known to be pretty good in this section of training.\n",
      "It is definitely not fake and has had numerous students take their courses and benefit from them. They have gotten some good reviews from their students as well as media houses. Go check out their website. You will definitely get better info.\n",
      "\n",
      "483) I am currently enrolled to their Full Stack Data Science course. Frankly, the course material and content is pretty average. They will promise big things before enrolling, but all of that is lies. I would advise people to do their homework and not get carried away by false promises from such institutes. Save your hard earned money and get more knowledge by referring to free videos and websites.\n",
      "\n",
      "484) I am 2016 student of Jigsaw. I was part of the student Whatsapp group as well. Many of my co-students kept complaining about not getting a job. I found this strange because they had not even finished one course and were talking about 7 lakh jobs. Some of them were of the opinion that they have paid the course fee and now job should come automatically.\n",
      "Jigsaw LMS has many job opportunities. Some of them are valid for freshers. Others require some experience.\n",
      "Jigsaw will not get you placed. They can only give you access to job openings. I also think that the changes they suggested on my resume were very good.\n",
      "I think some students have unrealistic expectations. They dont want to work hard but want rewards.\n",

      "7) The experience with the academy was worse, the faculty members are pre opined, favouritism based on regionalism is considerably alarming. They are just making money ,not providing adequate professional knowledge. Very unprofessional approach towards the students, the worst academy ever seen.\n",
      "\n",
      "8) Bad environment for learning data science, no corporation from staff. Bad attitude. Vidya analytics review about them are fake.\n",
      "\n",
      "9) Worst academy, don't spend your hard-earned money here. I regret choosing the data science bootcamp weekday course here. The course was supposed to for a month and a half but it was actually taught in less than a month. The staff threatens you saying if you come late by 15 mins they will mark you absent and if there's not enough attendance they will not give you certificate(what a joke). They mark attendance for the first and second half of the day. They give you pre-written codes and ask you to just run it which is not very helpful. They taught statistics in a day, excel in a day, R in 5-6 days and python in around 3 days. The good reviews on here seem fake to me. I spent a lot of my money in this institute and it was all worthless. Udemy offers lifetime access to their courses and these guys give access to online content for 6 months, what a waste. Data science is vast, think before you pick out a short term course. The course that I took felt like a refresher, they don't care if you have learnt the concepts or not. I have never seen such unprofessional, rude staff and I wish I could take it all back.\n",
      "Edit: to whoever replied, I have proof that I joined this year, very smart marketing reply. To the people who are reading reviews please consider the kind of reviews this institution is getting, conveniently vague and short. It's fishy. Be smart with your money.\n",
      "\n",
      "10) In machine , statistics class taken by Manoj, was very bad. Placement support is useless. It's only for shake of name.\n",
      "\n",
      "11) Big frauds. They force everyone with false promises. Online course materials and teachings are very bad. One can get good materials in free youtube videos only.\n",
      "\n",
      "12) Worst academy. They are focusing on customers only for week and after the payment they didn't give proper answer. Even lectures are not understandable and they are just doing marketing by using Data Science words.\n",
      "\n",
      "13) I have worst experience enrolling my self one of data science courses. They just bother about money. Once you paid the fees after that they won't care about you. I paid 51,000 INR . It was total waste. In name of online service they provide junk material and moreover also some time it wont work. If you call their customer service desk they won't pick your phone. they also do false promise on placement assistants. So be care full while enrolling your self with Jigsa. There are other good institute in the same line of business.\n",
      "\n",
      "14) World class professionally managed institute that will help you in covering the arduous journey on the path of data-science .Good guidance and placement support.Worth every penny i invested in the courses.\n",

      "15) Job Prospects : I was recruited because of a course I completed at Jigsaw.\n",
      "Pros : (1) Excellent Content (2) Hands-On experience with near to real life business case studies\n",
      "(3) Helpful Faculty\n",
      "Cons : (1) Less importance on doubt clearance (2) Lack of actual classroom sessions & only digital interaction with batch mates tends to make you procrastinate\n",
      "Overall Review : A good choice for anyone who wants to switch over to analytics and/or is entirely new to the world of analytics.\n",
      "Things to keep in mind : (1) Even though they don't say it, the student is expected to have some statistical base already. 'R For Dummies' book & certain MOOCs at eDX filled in all the blanks where Jigsaw failed. (2) Apply for the job only after you've completed at least one course from Jigsaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "16) Really expensive and courses are not worth of it. Learners note that they are only offering 100% placement assistance. And the worst part is that most of the analytics companies do not consider those who don't have experience. Also their topics are not enough to acquire a career in analytics. Still if you are planning to do analytics, my opinion is that go for R programming or python, not for SAS.\n",
      "\n",
      "17) Bad attitude, totally commercial place , not the place for freshers to learn Machine learning and Artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "18) Not worth of giving money for machine learning and AI course\n",
      "\n",
      "19) I wouldn't suggest jigsaw, infact i don't think even a single star is eligible for jigsaw academy. As a student of Jigsaw, what i can say is\n",
      "1) The presentations are very bad, infact the presentations are elementary level and when it comes to assignments, its so damn complex that we wont be able to solve it. But very pathetic material, and that's the objective of jigsaw academy, because historically students have found it difficult to complete the course barring a few and jigsaw guys knows it too, and over the course of all this complications our access period to the material too gets over making us at loss\n",
      "2) They charge so high almost every course, which is not worth even a single penny. Because once the money is paid ball is in their court and they are least bothered.\n",
      "3) I have had pretty bad experience with the faculty. I mean this is my personal experience.\n",
      "Kindly think and enroll here, because if i sum-up i can tell this about jigsaw. Heavily priced courses with primitive level of materials and u landing up not completing the course because u need to complete 70% of assignments to get certificate, not worth it taking up in jigsaw. For all the guys out there, kindly think and take up jigsaw, infact there are better places out there with good prices along with better materials and faculty support.\n",
      "\n",
      "20) I have never come across such pathetic institute, who are literally cheating people telling all false things. This is very bad & they are telling future career will be good. But nothing is happening no support what so ever. Disgusting the entire jigsaw is of no use. Please do not enrol into any course.\n",
      "\n",

      "23) Very poor support provided to me by their support team. I am not able to complete 1 week course in 1 month because of their pathetic support.\n",

      "27) Not Good at all, Waste of money & time\n",

      "\n",
      "31) Honest review by Current student. 1. I had a very very bad experience from Jigsaw. not only me. I have lots of co students who had experience who studied from Jigsaw. 2. Certification : Certification is very useless. No companies are accepting the Jigsaw Certification. Even they are asking whats Jigsaw Academy. From this I understand Jigsaw only claims that it has been widely accepted by companies. Again it is a cheating (marketing gimmick) to enroll more students. 3.Counselling and Enrolling: Lots and lots of Fake statements given be counsellor (jigsaw) to enroll you. You ll realize once you jigsaw. If you want to lose your hard earned money in river, then you can proceed. 4. Placement : Wow, What a placement support. From the day i completed the course, lots and lots of job opportunities they are posting. But it requires experience. Haha. You cant apply to any of those companies. Please think about this - Those who want to enter into Analytics will have no analytics experience. If so, to whom they are sending the placement opportunties. Again its a marketing gimmick to enroll more students 5. Mock Interviews : Very very funny one. there are some faculties there whose behaviour will be very rude to students who ask doubts. Wow what a faculty support If you have huge money and dont mind spending for useless thing, you can invest here\n",

      "I had enrolled for a combo course in Jigsaw Academy in the month of January, 2016. This is an earnest opinion, i dont think its worth investing in jigsaw, i am just regretting spending money here and the fees here is huge for no reason but the services is bad. Because the material i feel is way too simple for us to do any assignments given by them, which is too complex. Secondly, even after lodging a complaint, the faculty doesn't even bother to cal back or even if we intimate to the support team the issues we are facing, they show concerns(by repeatedly telling sorry’s) but no action is taken. I, initially thought i was not following the course, but it turns out majority of people are finding it difficult to understand jigsaw's material nor unable to do the assignments and the worst part is that u pay the entire money initially leaving us with nothing, so even if we face difficulties there’s no need for jigsaw to show interest, since they have the money in their hands, speaking about the fees, for thee quality they are providing the fees is skyrocketing which is not even worth. Finally with despair, pain and tears i am regretting joining jigsaw academy, a lot i have spent on this institute for which i am in deep pain and which i know i wont get back too. I see below lots of good reviews, which might be hardly 1–2% of candidates enrolling the rest are struggling. Kindly look into other options who are giving for cheaper and better services. Jigsaw is all about money and no services\n",

      "35) Very bad experience, dont prefer online education, you will never satisfied your money will be worst ,\n",
      "Try only your nearest offline class , you can ask obviously , no any customer support properly, you cant even get any proper note or template for reference.\n",
      "Dont waste your money\n",
      "I feel same here I wate my 50000 here by doing online course. Data analysis,\n",
      "They will try to convince and saying no meaning of review fake review\n",
      "You can contact me on8160906899\n",
      "\n",
      "36) NOOOOOOOO way jigsaw is very poor at teaching .very ill planned and irrelevant teaching.i was enrolled for june 2017 batch but i found the course in context less taeching. we need some basics first and then only we can relate to any subject.\n",
      "it was just like teaching english /french by reading aloud essays in language with no teaching and understanding of grammar….totally contextless..\n",
      "they have invested lot in advertisement so they come first in google search and people fall trap to them. all my batchmates who enrolled alongwith me also bear same opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "37) I choose Jigsaw academy for one of the data analyst course last year. Every single forum is saying that it was good among rest of the institute. So I choose them. I was learning Excel and SAS along with other techniques.\n",
      "Excel :- I was already pro at excel, so I cleared the content easily. But their content was quite messy. They actually draft the classes/videos in untidy way. It was easier for me understand, but anyone new to advance excel can find that bit tough.\n",
      "SAS and stats techniques :- Poor draft of the videos continue here as well. I was new to SAS and other stats techniques, so it was bit difficult to understand. However after learning SAS from other youtube videos. I was able to crack it.\n",
      "when I was enrolled they were using WPS for teaching SAS techniques. I think now they are using SAS university edition for this. But WPS was again a headache for me.\n",
      "Placement :- THEY WILL NOT HELP YOU TO GETTING PLACE. it is learning platform for a student and earning platform for them. Placement is something they actually dont understand. Forget about the placement, their placement services are pathetic. They dont even help you to write your resume or mock test.\n",
      "I was in touch with them through out my course duration. Now they are complaining that my phone is not reachable for placement services.\n",
      "Plus they post jobs from other employment portals. but the catch here is that they dont have jobs for freshers. Someone from data science or AI with the relevant experience is required. And most of the students are freshers, so they dont fit here. I was having experience (not in data science ) but eligible for jobs.\n",
      "Please dont waste your hard earned money. it is only market gimmick.\n",
